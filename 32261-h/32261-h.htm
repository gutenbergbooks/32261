<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="tt">Departure&mdash;The Atlantic&mdash;Demoralization of
the &ldquo;Boarders&rdquo;&mdash;Betting&mdash;The Auctioneer&mdash;An
Inquisitive Yankee.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>On board the &ldquo;Celtic,&rdquo; Christmas Week,</i> 1889.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">In</span> the order of things the <i>Teutonic</i> was to have
sailed to-day, but the date is the 25th of December,
and few people elect to eat their Christmas dinner
on the ocean if they can avoid it; so there are only
twenty-five saloon passengers, and they have been committed
to the brave little <i>Celtic</i>, while that huge floating
palace, the <i>Teutonic</i>, remains in harbor.</p>

<p>Little <i>Celtic</i>! Has it come to this with her and her
companions, the <i>Germanic</i>, the <i>Britannic</i>, and the rest
that were the wonders and the glory of the ship-building
craft a few years ago? There is something almost
sad in seeing these queens of the Atlantic dethroned,
and obliged to rank below newer and grander ships.
It was even pathetic to hear the remarks of the sailors,
as we passed the <i>Germanic</i> who, in her day, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
created even more wondering admiration than the two
famous armed cruisers lately added to the &ldquo;White
Star&rdquo; fleet.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I know nothing more monotonous than a voyage
from Liverpool to New York.</p>

<p>Nine times out of ten&mdash;not to say ninety-nine times
out of a hundred&mdash;the passage is bad. The Atlantic
Ocean has an ugly temper; it has forever got its back
up. Sulky, angry, and terrible by turns, it only takes
a few days&rsquo; rest out of every year, and this always occurs
when you are not crossing.</p>

<p>And then, the wind is invariably against you.
When you go to America, it blows from the west;
when you come back to Europe, it blows from the east.
If the captain steers south to avoid icebergs, it is sure
to begin to blow southerly.</p>

<p>Doctors say that sea-sickness emanates from the brain.
I can quite believe them. The blood rushes to your
head, leaving your extremities cold and helpless. All
the vital force flies to the brain, and your legs refuse
to carry you. It is with sea-sickness as it is with wine.
When people say that a certain wine goes up in the
head, it means that it is more likely to go down to the
feet.</p>

<p>There you are, on board a huge construction that
rears and kicks like a buck-jumper. She lifts you up
bodily, and, after well shaking all your members in the
air several seconds, lets them down higgledy-piggledy,
leaving to Providence the business of picking them up
and putting them together again. That is the kind of
thing one has to go through about sixty times an hour.
And there is no hope for you; nobody dies of it.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, the mental state of the boarders
may easily be imagined. They smoke, they play
cards, they pace the deck like bruin pacing a cage; or
else they read, and forget at the second chapter all they
have read in the first. A few presumptuous ones try
to think, but without success. The ladies, the American
ones more especially, lie on their deck chairs
swathed in rugs and shawls like Egyptian mummies in
their sarcophagi, and there they pass from ten to
twelve hours a day motionless, hopeless, helpless,
speechless. Some few incurables keep to their cabins
altogether, and only show their wasted faces when it is
time to debark. Up they come, with cross, stupefied,
pallid, yellow-green-looking physiognomies, and seeming
to say: &ldquo;Speak to me, if you like, but don&rsquo;t expect
me to open my eyes or answer you, and above all,
don&rsquo;t shake me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Impossible to fraternize.</p>

<p>The crossing now takes about six days and a half.
By the time you have spent two in getting your sea
legs on, and three more in reviewing, and being reviewed
by your fellow-passengers, you will find yourself
at the end of your troubles&mdash;and your voyage.</p>

<p>No, people do not fraternize on board ship, during
such a short passage, unless a rumor runs from cabin
to cabin that there has been some accident to the machinery,
or that the boat is in imminent danger. At the
least scare of this kind, every one looks at his neighbor
with eyes that are alarmed, but amiable, nay, even
amicable. But as soon as one can say: &ldquo;We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
come off with a mere scare this time,&rdquo; all the facial
traits stiffen once more, and nobody knows anybody.</p>

<p>Universal grief only will bring about universal
brotherhood. We must wait till the Day of Judgment.
When the world is passing away, oh! how
men will forgive and love one another! What
outpourings of good-will and affection there will
be! How touching, how edifying will be the sight!
The universal republic will be founded in the
twinkling of an eye, distinctions of creed and
class forgotten. The author will embrace the
critic and even the publisher, the socialist open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
his arms to the capitalist. The married men will be
seen &ldquo;making it up&rdquo; with their mothers-in-law, begging
them to forgive and forget, and admitting that
they had not been always quite so-so, in fact, as they
might have been. If the Creator of all is a philosopher,
or enjoys humor, how he will be amused to
see all the various sects of Christians, who have passed
their lives in running one another down, throw themselves
into one another&rsquo;s arms. It will be a scene
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Yes, I repeat it, the voyage from Liverpool to New
York is monotonous and wearisome in the extreme.
It is an interval in one&rsquo;s existence, a week more or
less lost, decidedly more than less.</p>

<p>One grows gelatinous from head to foot, especially
in the upper part of one&rsquo;s anatomy.</p>

<p>In order to see to what an extent the brain softens,
you only need look at the pastimes the poor passengers
go in for.</p>

<p>A state of demoralization prevails throughout.</p>

<p>They bet. That is the form the disease takes.</p>

<p class="caption">THE AUCTIONEER.</p></div>

<p>They bet on anything and everything. They bet
that the sun will or will not appear next day at eleven
precisely, or that rain will fall at noon. They bet that
the number of miles made by the boat at twelve o&rsquo;clock
next day will terminate with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or
9. Each draws one of these numbers and pays his
shilling, half-crown, or even sovereign. Then these
numbers are put up at auction. An improvised
auctioneer, with the gift of the gab, puts his talent at
the service of his fellow-passengers. It is really very
funny to see him swaying about the smoking-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
table, and using all his eloquence over each number in
turn for sale. A good auctioneer will run the bidding
so smartly that the winner of the pool next day often
pockets as much as thirty and forty pounds. On the
eve of arrival in New York harbor, everybody knows
that twenty-four pilots are waiting about for the advent
of the liner, and that each boat carries her number on
her sail. Accordingly, twenty-four numbers are rolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
up and thrown into a cap, and betting begins again.
He who has drawn the number which happens to be
that of the pilot who takes the steamer into harbor
pockets the pool.</p>

<p>I, who have never bet on anything in my life, even bet
with my traveling companion, when the rolling of the
ship sends our portmanteaus from one side of the
cabin to the other, that mine will arrive first. Intellectual
faculties on board are reduced to this ebb.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a gay note, in this concert
of groans and grumblings, is struck by some humorous
and good-tempered American. He will come and ask
you the most impossible questions with an ease and
impudence perfectly inimitable. These catechisings
are all the more droll because they are done with a
<i>naïveté</i> which completely disarms you. The phrase is
short, without verb, reduced to its most concise expression.
The intonation alone marks the interrogation.
Here is a specimen.</p>

<p>We have on board the <i>Celtic</i> an American who is not
a very shrewd person, for it has actually taken him
five days to discover that English is not my native
tongue. This morning (December 30) he found it out,
and, being seated near me in the smoke-room, has just
had the following bit of conversation with me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foreigner?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foreigner,&rdquo; said I, replying in American.</p>

<p>&ldquo;German, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, the <i>arnticle of Pahrriss</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so. Excuse <i>my</i> pronunciation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This floored him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather impertinent, your smoke-room neighbor!&rdquo;
you will say.</p>

<p>Undeceive yourself at once upon that point. It is
not impertinence, still less an intention to offend you,
that urges him to put these incongruous questions to
you. It is the interest he takes in you. The American
is a good fellow; good fellowship is one of his
chief characteristic traits. Of that I became perfectly
convinced during my last visit to the United States.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="tt1">Arrival of the Pilot&mdash;First Look at American
Newspapers.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Saturday, January</i> 4, 1890.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">We</span> shall arrive in New York Harbor to-night,
but too late to go on shore. After sunset,
the Custom House officers are not to be disturbed.
We are about to land in a country where, as I remember,
everything is in subjection to the paid servant.
In the United States, he who is paid wages commands.</p>

<p>We make the best of it. After having mercilessly
tumbled us about for nine days, the wind has graciously
calmed down, and our last day is going to be
a good one, thanks be. There is a pure atmosphere.
A clear line at the horizon divides space into two
immensities, two sheets of blue sharply defined.</p>

<p>Faces are smoothing out a bit. People talk, are
becoming, in fact, quite communicative. One seems
to say to another: &ldquo;Why, after all, you don&rsquo;t look
half as disagreeable as I thought. If I had only
known that, we might have seen more of each other,
and killed time more quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pilot boat is in sight. It comes toward us, and
sends off in a rowing-boat the pilot who will take us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
into port. The arrival of the pilot on board is not an
incident. It is an event. Does he not bring the
New York newspapers? And when you have been ten
days at sea, cut off from the world, to read the papers
of the day before is to come back to life again, and
once more take up your
place in this little planet that
has been going on its jog-trot
way during your temporary
suppression.</p>

<p>The first article which
meets my eyes, as I open
the New York <i>World</i>, is
headed &ldquo;High time for
Mr. Nash to put
a stop to it!&rdquo;
This is the paragraph:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Ten days ago,
Mrs. Nash brought
a boy into existence.
Three days
afterward she presented
her husband
with a little girl. Yesterday the lady was safely delivered of a
third baby.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nash takes her time over it&rdquo; would have been
another good heading.</p>

<p>Here we are in America. Old World ways don&rsquo;t obtain
here. In Europe, Mrs. Nash would have ushered
the little trio into this life in one day; but in Europe
we are out of date, <i>rococo</i>, and if one came over to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
the Americans doing things just as they are done on the
other side, one might as well stay at home.</p>

<p>I run through the papers.</p>

<p>America, I see, is split into two camps. Two young
ladies, Miss Nelly Bly and Miss Elizabeth Bisland,
have left New York by opposite routes to go around
the world, the former sent by the New York <i>World</i>,
the latter by the <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. Which will be back
first? is what all America is conjecturing upon. Bets
have been made, and the betting is even. I do not
know Miss Bly, but last time I came over I had the
pleasure of making Miss Bisland&rsquo;s acquaintance. Naturally,
as soon as I get on shore, I shall bet on Miss
Bisland. You would do the same yourself, would you
not?</p>

<p>I pass the day reading the papers. All the bits of
news, insignificant or not, given in the shape of crisp,
lively stories, help pass the time. They contain little
information, but much amusement. The American
newspaper always reminds me of a shop window with
all the goods ticketed in a marvelous style, so as to attract
and tickle the eye. You cannot pass over anything.
The leading article is scarcely known across
the &ldquo;wet spot&rdquo;; the paper is a collection of bits of
gossip, hearsay, news, scandal, the whole served <i>à la
sauce piquante</i>.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Nine o&rsquo;clock.</i></p>

<p>We are passing the bar, and going to anchor. New
York is sparkling with lights, and the Brooklyn Bridge
is a thing of beauty. I will enjoy the scene for an
hour, and then turn in.</p>

<p>We land to-morrow morning at seven.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="tt">Arrival&mdash;The Custom House&mdash;Things Look
Bad&mdash;The Interviewers&mdash;First Visits&mdash;Things
Look Brighter&mdash;&ldquo;O Vanity of Vanities.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York Harbor; January</i> 5.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">At</span> seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning the Custom House
officers came on board. One of them at once
recognizing me, said, calling me by name, that he was
glad to see me back, and inquired if I had not brought
Madame with me this time. It is extraordinary the
memory of many of these Americans! This one had
seen me for a few minutes two years before, and probably
had had to deal with two or three hundred thousand
people since.</p>

<p>All the passengers came to the saloon and made
their declarations one after another, after which they
swore in the usual form that they had told the truth,
and signed a paper to that effect. This done, many a
poor pilgrim innocently imagines that he has finished
with the Custom House, and he renders thanks to
Heaven that he is going to set foot on a soil where a
man&rsquo;s word is not doubted. He reckons without his
host. In spite of his declaration, sworn and signed,
his trunks are opened and searched with all the
dogged zeal of a policeman who believes he is on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
track of a criminal, and who will only give up after
perfectly convincing himself that the trunks do not
contain the slightest dutiable article. Everything is
taken out and examined. If there are any objects of
apparel that appear like new ones to that scrutinizing
eye, look out for squalls.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:433px; height:500px" src="images/img026.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICERS.</p></div>

<p>I must say that the officer was very kind to me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
For that matter, the luggage of a man who travels
alone, without Madame and her <i>impedimenta</i>, is soon
examined.</p>

<p>Before leaving the ship, I went to shake hands with
Captain Parsell, that experienced sailor whose bright,
interesting conversation, added to the tempting delicacies
provided by the cook, made many an hour pass
right cheerily for those who, like myself, had the
good fortune to sit at his table. I thanked him for all
the kind attentions I had received at his hands. I
should have liked to thank all the employees of the
&ldquo;White Star&rdquo; line company. Their politeness is
above all praise; their patience perfectly angelical.
Ask them twenty times a day the most absurd questions,
such as, &ldquo;Will the sea soon calm down?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall
we get into harbor on Wednesday?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you think
we shall be in early enough to land in the evening?&rdquo;
and so on. You find them always ready with a kind
and encouraging answer. &ldquo;The barometer is going up
and the sea is going down,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;We are now doing our
nineteen knots an hour.&rdquo; Is it true, or not? It satisfies
you, at all events. In certain cases it is so
sweet to be deceived! Better to be left to nurse a beloved
illusion than have to give it up for a harsh reality
that you are powerless against. Every one is
grateful to those kind sailors and stewards for the
little innocent fibs that they are willing to load their
consciences with, in order that they may brighten your
path across the ocean a little.</p>

<p>My baggage examined, I took a cab to go to the
hotel. Three dollars for a mile and a half. A mere
trifle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:430px; height:365px" src="images/img030.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">EVERY ONE HAS THE GRIPPE.</p></div>

<p>It was pouring with rain. New York on a Sunday
is never very gay. To-day the city seemed to me horrible:
dull, dirty, and dreary. It is not the fault of
New York altogether. I have the spleen. A horribly
stormy passage, the stomach upside down, the heart up
in the throat, the thought that my dear ones are three
thousand miles away, all these things help to make
everything look black. It would have needed a
radiant sun in one of those pure blue skies that North
America is so rich in to make life look agreeable and
New York passable to-day.</p>

<p>In ten minutes cabby set me down at the Everett
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
House. After having signed the register, I went and
looked up my manager, whose bureau is on the ground
floor of the hotel.</p>

<p>The spectacle which awaited me was appalling.</p>

<p>There sat the unhappy Major Pond in his office, his
head bowed upon his chest, his arms hanging limp, the
very picture of despair.</p>

<p>The country is seized with a panic. Everybody has
the influenza. Every one does not die of it, but every
one is having it. The malady is not called influenza
over here, as it is in Europe. It is called &ldquo;Grippe.&rdquo;
No American escapes it. Some have <i>la grippe</i>, others
have <i>the grippe</i>, a few, even, have <i>the la grippe</i>. Others,
again, the lucky ones, think they have it. Those who
have not had it, or do not think they have it yet,
are expecting it. The nation is in a complete state of
demoralization. Theaters are empty, business almost
suspended, doctors on their backs or run off their
legs.</p>

<p>At twelve a telegram is handed to me. It is from
my friend, Wilson Barrett, who is playing in Philadelphia.
&ldquo;Hearty greetings, dear friend. Five grains of
quinine and two tablets of antipyrine a day, or you
get <i>grippe</i>.&rdquo; Then came many letters by every post.
&ldquo;Impossible to go and welcome you in person. I
have <i>la grippe</i>. Take every precaution.&rdquo; Such is the
tenor of them all.</p>

<p>The outlook is not bright. What to do? For a
moment I have half a mind to call a cab and get
on board the first boat bound for Europe.</p>

<p>I go to my room, the windows of which overlook
Union Square. The sky is somber, the street is black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
and deserted, the air is suffocatingly warm, and a very
heavy rain is beating against the windows.</p>

<p>Shade of Columbus, how I wish I were home
again!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Cheer up, boy, the hand-grasps of your dear New
York friends will be sweet after the frantic grasping
of stair-rails and other ship furniture for so many
days.</p>

<p>I will have lunch and go and pay calls.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Excuse me if I leave you for a few minutes. The
interviewers are waiting for me downstairs in Major
Pond&rsquo;s office. The interviewers! a gay note at last.
The hall porter hands me their cards. They are all
there: representatives of the <i>Tribune</i>, the <i>Times</i>, the
<i>Sun</i>, the <i>Herald</i>, the <i>World</i>, the <i>Star</i>.</p>

<p>What nonsense Europeans have written on the
subject of interviewing in America, to be sure! To
hear them speak, you would believe that it is the
greatest nuisance in the world.</p>

<p>A Frenchman writes in the <i>Figaro</i>: &ldquo;I will go to
America if my life can be insured against that terrific
nuisance, interviewing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An Englishman writes to an English paper, on
returning from America: &ldquo;When the reporters called
on me, I invariably refused to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trash! Cant! Hypocrisy! With the exception
of a king, or the prime minister of one of the great
powers, a man is only too glad to be interviewed.
Don&rsquo;t talk to me about the nuisance, tell the truth,
it is always such a treat to hear it. I consider that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
interviewing is a compliment, a great compliment paid
to the interviewed. In asking a man to give you his
views, so as to enlighten the public on such and such
a subject, you acknowledge that he is an important
man, which is flattering to him; or you take him for
one, which is more flattering still.</p>

<p>I maintain that American interviewers are extremely
courteous and obliging, and, as a rule, very faithful
reporters of what you say to them.</p>

<p>Let me say that I have a lurking doubt in my mind
whether those who have so much to say against interviewing
in America have ever been asked to be interviewed
at all, or have even ever run such a danger.</p>

<p>I object to interviewing as a sign of decadence in
modern journalism; but I do not object to being
interviewed, I like it; and, to prove it, I will go down
at once, and be interviewed.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Midnight.</i></p>

<p>The interview with the New York reporters passed
off very well. I went through the operation like a
man.</p>

<p>After lunch, I went to see Mr. Edmund Clarence
Stedman, who had shown me a great deal of kindness
during my first visit to America. I found in him a
friend ready to welcome me.</p>

<p>The poet and literary critic is a man of about fifty,
rather below middle height, with a beautifully chiseled
head. In every one of the features you can detect
the artist, the man of delicate, tender, and refined
feelings. It was a great pleasure for me to see him
again. He has finished his &ldquo;Library of American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
Literature,&rdquo; a gigantic work of erudite criticism and
judicious compilation, which he undertook a few years
ago in collaboration with Miss Ellen Mackay Hutchinson.
These eleven volumes form a perfect national
monument, a complete cyclopædia of American literature,
giving extracts from the writings of every
American who has published anything for the last
three hundred years (1607-1890).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:340px; height:350px" src="images/img034.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE INTERVIEWERS.</p></div>

<p>On leaving him, I went to call on Mrs. Anna Bowman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
Dodd, the author of &ldquo;Cathedral Days,&rdquo; &ldquo;Glorinda,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Republic of the Future,&rdquo; and other
charming books, and one of the brightest conversationalists
it has ever been my good fortune to meet.
After an hour&rsquo;s chat with her, I had forgotten all
about the <i>grippe</i>, and all other more or less imaginary
miseries.</p>

<p>I returned to the Everett House to dress, and went
to the Union League Club to dine with General Horace
Porter.</p>

<p>The general possesses a rare and most happy combination
of brilliant flashing Parisian wit and dry, quiet,
American humor. This charming <i>causeur</i> and <i>conteur</i>
tells an anecdote as nobody I know can do; he
never misses fire. He assured me at table that the
copyright bill will soon be passed, for, he added, &ldquo;we
have now a pure and pious Administration. At the
White House they open their oysters with prayer.&rdquo;
The conversation fell on American society, or, rather,
on American Societies. The highest and lowest of
these can be distinguished by the use of <i>van</i>. &ldquo;The
blue blood of America put it before their names, as
<i>Van Nicken</i>; political society puts it after, as <i>Sullivan</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">O Van-itas Van-itatum!</span></p>

<p>Time passed rapidly in such delightful company.</p>

<p>I finished the evening at the house of Colonel
Robert G. Ingersoll. If there had been any cloud of
gloom still left hanging about me, it would have vanished
at the sight of his sunny face. There was a
small gathering of some thirty people, among them
Mr. Edgar Fawcett, whose acquaintance I was delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
to make. Conversation went on briskly with one and
the other, and at half-past eleven I returned to the
hotel completely cured.</p>

<p>To-morrow morning I leave for Boston at ten o&rsquo;clock
to begin the lecture tour in that city, or, to use an
Americanism, to &ldquo;open the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>There is a knock at the door.</p>

on Thursday next, the 16th.</p>

<p>I look at my list of engagements and find I am in
Pittsburg on that day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span> </p>

<p>I take a telegraph form and pen the following, which
I will send to my friend, Major M. P. Handy, the
president of this lively association:</p>

<p>Many thanks. Am engaged in Pittsburg on the 16th. Thank
God, cannot attend your dinner.</p>

<p>I remember how those &ldquo;boys&rdquo; cheeked me two
years ago, laughed at me, sat on me. That&rsquo;s my telegram
to you, dear Cloverites, with my love.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="tt1">Impressions of American Hotels.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Boston</i>, <i>January</i> 6.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Arrived</span> here this afternoon, and resumed acquaintance
with American hotels.</p>

<p>American hotels are all alike.</p>

<p>Some are worse.</p>

<p>Describe one and you have described them all.</p>

<p>On the ground floor, a large entrance hall strewed
with cuspidores for the men, and a side entrance provided
with a triumphal arch for the ladies. On this
floor the sexes are separated as at the public baths.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:412px; height:500px" src="images/img039.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SAD-EYED CLERK.</p></div>

<p>In the large hall, a counter behind which solemn
clerks, whose business faces relax not a muscle, are
ready with their book to enter your name and assign
you a number. A small army of colored porters ready
to take you in charge. Not a salute, not a word, not
a smile of welcome. The negro takes your bag and
makes a sign that your case is settled. You follow
him. For the time being you lose your personality
and become No. 375, as you would in jail. Don&rsquo;t ask
questions; theirs not to answer; don&rsquo;t ring the bell to
ask for a favor, if you set any value on your time. All
the rules of the establishment are printed and posted
in your bedroom; you have to submit to them. No
question to ask&mdash;you know everything. Henceforth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
you will have to be hungry from 7 to 9 A.M.; from 1
to 3 P.M.; from 6 to 8 P.M. The slightest infringement
of the routine would stop the wheel, so don&rsquo;t ask if you
could have a meal at four o&rsquo;clock; you would be taken
for a lunatic, or a crank (as they call it in America).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span> </p>

<p>Between meals you will be supplied with ice-water
<i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>No privacy. No coffee-room, no smoking-room.
No place where you can go and quietly sip a cup of
coffee or drink a glass of beer with a cigar. You can
have a drink at the bar, and then go and sit down in
the hall among the crowd.</p>

<p>Life in an American hotel is an alternation of the
cellular system during the night and of the gregarious
system during the day, an alternation of the penitentiary
systems carried out at Philadelphia and at Auburn.</p>

<p>It is not in the bedroom, either, that you must seek
anything to cheer you. The bed is good, but only for
the night. The room is perfectly nude. Not even
&ldquo;Napoleon&rsquo;s Farewell to his Soldiers at Fontainebleau&rdquo;
as in France, or &ldquo;Strafford walking to the
Scaffold&rdquo; as in England. Not that these pictures are
particularly cheerful, still they break the monotony of
the wall paper. Here the only oases in the brown or
gray desert are cautions.</p>

<p>First of all, a notice that, in a cupboard near the
window, you will find some twenty yards of coiled rope
which, in case of fire, you are to fix to a hook outside
the window. The rest is guessed. You fix the rope,
and&mdash;you let yourself go. From a sixth, seventh, or
eighth story, the prospect is lively. Another caution
informs you of all that you must not do, such as your
own washing in the bedroom. Another warns you that
if, on retiring, you put your boots outside the door, you
do so at your own risk and peril. Another is posted
near the door, close to an electric bell. With a little
care and practice, you will be able to carry out the
instructions printed thereon. The only thing wonderful
about the contrivance is that the servants never
make mistakes.

<p>In some hotels I have seen the list carried to number
twelve.</p>

<p>Another notice tells you what the proprietor&rsquo;s responsibilities
are, and at what time the meals take
place. Now this last notice is the most important of
all. Woe to you if you forget it! For if you should
present yourself one minute after the dining-room door
is closed, no human consideration would get it open
for you. Supplications, arguments would be of no
avail. Not even money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; some old-fashioned European
will exclaim. &ldquo;When the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i> is over,
of course you cannot expect the <i>menu</i> to be served to
you; but surely you can order a steak or a chop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, you cannot, not even an omelette or a piece of
cold meat. If you arrive at one minute past three (in
small towns, at one minute past two) you find the
dining-room closed, and you must wait till six o&rsquo;clock
to see its hospitable doors open again.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>When you enter the dining-room, you must not believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
that you can go and sit where you like. The chief
waiter assigns you a seat, and you must take it. With
a superb wave of the hand, he signs to you to follow
him. He does not even turn round to see if you are
behind him, following him in all the meanders he describes,
amid the sixty, eighty, sometimes hundred
tables that are in the room. He takes it for granted
you are an obedient, submissive traveler who knows
his duty. Altogether I traveled in the United States
for about ten months, and I never came across an
American so daring, so independent, as to actually
take any other seat than the one assigned to him by
that tremendous potentate, the head waiter. Occasionally,
just to try him, I would sit down in a chair I
took a fancy to. But he would come and fetch me,
and tell me that I could not stay there. In Europe,
the waiter asks you where you would like to sit. In
America, you ask him where you may sit. He is a
paid servant, therefore a master in America. He is in
command, not of the other waiters, but of the guests.
Several times, recognizing friends in the dining-room,
I asked the man to take me to their tables (I should
not have dared go by myself), and the permission was
granted with a patronizing sign of the head. I have
constantly seen Americans stop on the threshold of
the dining-room door, and wait until the chief waiter
had returned from placing a guest to come and fetch
them in their turn. I never saw them venture alone,
and take an empty seat, without the sanction of the
waiter.</p>

<p class="caption">THE HEAD MAN.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span></p>

<p>The guests feel struck with awe in that dining-room,
and solemnly bolt their food as quickly as they can.
You hear less noise in an American hotel dining-room
containing five hundred people, than you do at a
French <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i> accommodating fifty people, at a
German one containing a dozen guests, or at a table
where two Italians
are dining <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;LOOK LIKE DUSKY PRINCES.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>The head waiter,
at large Northern
and Western hotels,
is a white man. In
the Southern ones,
he is a mulatto or a
black; but white or
black, he is always a
magnificent specimen
of his race.
There is not a ghost
of a savor of the
serving man about
him; no whiskers
and shaven upper
lips reminding you
of the waiters of the
Old World; but always
a fine mustache,
the twirling of which
helps to give an air
of <i>nonchalant</i> superiority to its wearer. The mulatto
head-waiters in the South really look like dusky
princes. Many of them are so handsome and carry
themselves so superbly that you find them very impressive
at first and would fain apologize to them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
You feel as if you wanted
to thank them for kindly
condescending to concern
themselves about anything
so commonplace as your seat
at table.</p>

<p>In smaller hotels, the
waiters are all waitresses.
The &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; is
done by damsels
entirely&mdash;or
rather by the
guests of the
hotel.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 390px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;SHE IS CROWNED WITH A GIGANTIC MASS
OF FRIZZLED HAIR.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>If the Southern
head waiter
looks like a
prince, what
shall we say of
the head-waitress
in the East,
the North, and
the West?
No term short
of queenly will
describe her
stately bearing
as she moves about among her bevy of reduced
duchesses. She is evidently chosen for her appearance.
She is &ldquo;divinely tall,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
divinely fair,&rdquo; and, as if to add to her importance,
she is crowned with a gigantic mass of frizzled
hair. All the waitresses have this coiffure. It is
a livery, as caps are in the Old World; but instead
of being a badge of servitude it looks, and is, alarmingly
emancipated&mdash;so much so that, before making
close acquaintance with my dishes, I always examine
them with great care. A beautiful mass of hair looks
lovely on the head of a woman, but <i>one</i> in your soup,
even if it had strayed from the tresses of your beloved
one, would make the corners of your mouth go down,
and the tip of your nose go up.</p>

<p>A regally handsome woman always &ldquo;goes well in
the landscape,&rdquo; as the French say, and I have seen
specimens of these waitresses so handsome and so
commanding-looking that, if they cared to come over
to Europe and play the queens in London pantomimes,
I feel sure they would command quite exceptional
prices, and draw big salaries and crowded houses.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The thing which strikes me most disagreeably, in the
American hotel dining-room, is the sight of the tremendous
waste of food that goes on at every meal.
No European, I suppose, can fail to be struck with
this; but to a Frenchman it would naturally be most
remarkable. In France, where, I venture to say,
people live as well as anywhere else, if not better,
there is a horror of anything like waste of good food.
It is to me, therefore, a repulsive thing to see the
wanton manner in which some Americans will waste
at one meal enough to feed several hungry fellow-creatures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span> </p>

<p>In the large hotels, conducted on the American
plan, there are rarely fewer than fifty different dishes
on the <i>menu</i> at dinner-time. Every day, and at every
meal, you may see people order three times as much
of this food as they could under any circumstances eat,
and, after picking it and spoiling one dish after another,
send the bulk away uneaten. I am bound to say that
this practice is not only to be observed in hotels where
the charge is so much per day, but in those conducted
on the European plan, that is, where you pay for every
item you order. There I notice that people proceed
in much the same wasteful fashion. It is evidently
not a desire to have more than is paid for, but simply
a bad and ugly habit. I hold that about five hundred
hungry people could be fed out of the waste that is
going on at such large hotels as the Palmer House or
the Grand Pacific Hotel of Chicago&mdash;and I have no
doubt that such five hundred hungry people could
easily be found in Chicago every day.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I think that many Europeans are prevented from
going to America by an idea that the expense of
traveling and living there is very great. This is
quite a delusion. For my part I find that hotels are
as cheap in America as in England at any rate, and
railway traveling in Pullman cars is certainly cheaper
than in European first-class carriages, and incomparably
more comfortable. Put aside in America such
hotels as Delmonico&rsquo;s, the Brunswick in New York;
the Richelieu in Chicago; and in England such hotels
as the Metropôle, the Victoria, the Savoy; and take
the good hotels of the country, such as the Grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
Pacific at Chicago; the West House at Minneapolis,
the Windsor at Montreal, the Cadillac at Detroit. I
only mention those I remember as the very best. In
these hotels, you are comfortably lodged and magnificently
fed for from three to five dollars a day. In
no good hotel of England, France, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland, would you get the same amount of comfort,
or even luxury, at the same price, and those who
require a sitting-room get it for a little less than they
would have to pay in a European hotel.</p>

<p>The only very dear hotels I have come across in the
United States are those of Virginia. There I have
been charged as much as two dollars a day, but never
in my life did I pay so dear for what I had, never
in my life did I see so many dirty rooms or so many
messes that were unfit for human food.</p>

<p>But I will just say this much for the American refinement
of feeling to be met with, even in the hotels
of Virginia, even in the &ldquo;lunch&rdquo; rooms in small stations,
you are supplied, at the end of each meal, with a
bowl of water&mdash;to rinse your mouth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="tt">My Opening Lecture&mdash;Reflections on Audiences
I Have Had&mdash;The Man who Won&rsquo;t
Smile&mdash;The One who Laughs too Soon, and
Many Others.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Boston</i>, <i>January</i> 7.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Began</span> my second American tour under most favorable
auspices last night, in the Tremont Temple.
The huge hall was crowded with an audience of about
2500 people&mdash;a most kind, warm, keen, and appreciative
audience. I was a little afraid of the Bostonians; I had
heard so much about their power of criticism that I had
almost come to the conclusion that it was next to impossible
to please them. The Boston newspapers this
morning give full reports of my lecture. All of them are
kind and most favorable. This is a good start, and I
feel hopeful.</p>

<p>The subject of my lecture was &ldquo;A National Portrait
Gallery of the Anglo-Saxon Races,&rdquo; in which I delineated
the English, the Scotch, and the American characters.
Strange to say, my Scotch sketches seemed to
tickle them most. This, however, I can explain to
myself. Scotch &ldquo;wut&rdquo; is more like American humor
than any kind of wit I know. There is about it
the same dryness, the same quaintness, the same preposterousness,
the same subtlety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span> </p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 290px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:242px; height:350px" src="images/img051.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">BOSTON.</td></tr></table>

<p>My Boston audience also seemed to enjoy my criticisms
of America and the Americans, which disposes
of the absurd belief that the Americans will not listen to
the criticism of their country. There are Americans
and Americans, as there
is criticism and criticism.
If you can speak of
people&rsquo;s virtues without
flattery; if you can speak
of their weaknesses
and failings with
kindness and good
humor, I believe
you can
criticise to
your heart&rsquo;s
content without
ever fearing
to give offense
to intelligent
and fair-minded
people.
I admire
and love the
Americans.
How could
they help seeing
it through all the little criticisms that I indulged
in on the platform? On the whole, I was delighted
with my Boston audience, and, to judge from the
reception they gave me, I believe I succeeded in
pleasing them. I have three more engagements in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
Boston, so I shall have the pleasure of meeting the
Bostonians again.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I have never been able to lecture, whether in England,
in Scotland, in Ireland or in America, without discovering,
somewhere in the hall, after speaking for five
minutes or so, an old gentleman who will not smile.
He was there last night, and it is evident that he is
going to favor me with his presence every night during
this second American tour. He generally sits near
the platform, and not unfrequently on the first row.
There is a horrible fascination about that man. You
cannot get your eyes off him. You do your utmost to
&ldquo;fetch him&rdquo;&mdash;you feel it to be your duty not to send
him home empty-headed; your conscience tells you
that he has not to please you, but that <i>you</i> are paid to
please him, and you struggle on. You would like to
slip into his pocket the price of his seat and have him
removed, or throw the water bottle at his face and
make him show signs of life. As it is, you try to look
the other way, but you know he is there, and that does
not improve matters.</p>

<p>Now this man, who will not smile, very often is not
so bad as he looks. You imagine that you bore him
to death, but you don&rsquo;t. You wonder how it is he
does not go, but the fact is he actually enjoys himself&mdash;inside.
Or, maybe, he is a professional man
himself, and no conjuror has ever been known to laugh
at another conjuror&rsquo;s tricks. A great American
humorist relates that, after speaking for an hour
and a half without succeeding in getting a smile from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
a certain man in the audience, he sent some one to inquire
into the state of his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, did you not enjoy the lecture that
has been delivered to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much indeed,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;it was a most
clever and entertaining lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you never smiled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I&rsquo;m a liar myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Sometimes there are other reasons to explain the
unsmiling man&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

<p>One evening I had lectured in Birmingham. On
the first row there sat the whole time an old gentleman,
with his umbrella standing between his legs, his
hands crossed on the handle, and his chin resting on
his hands. Frowning, his mouth gaping, and his eyes
perfectly vacant, he remained motionless, looking at
me, and for an hour and twenty minutes seemed to
say to me: &ldquo;My poor fellow, you may do what you
like, but you won&rsquo;t &lsquo;fetch&rsquo; me to-night, I can tell
you.&rdquo; I looked at him, I spoke to him, I winked at
him, I aimed at him; several times even I paused so
as to give him ample time to see a point. All was in
vain. I had just returned, after the lecture, to the secretary&rsquo;s
room behind the platform, when he entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that man again!&rdquo; I cried, pointing to
him.</p>

<p>He advanced toward me, took my hand, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for your excellent lecture, I
have enjoyed it very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:455px; height:610px" src="images/img054.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WILL NOT SMILE.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be kind enough to give me your autograph?&rdquo;
And he pulled out of his pocket a beautiful
autograph book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said to the secretary in a whisper, &ldquo;this
old gentleman is extremely kind to ask for my autograph,
for I am certain he has not enjoyed my lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he never smiled once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor old gentleman,&rdquo; said the secretary; &ldquo;he
is stone deaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many a lecturer must have met this man.</p>

<p>It would be unwise, when you discover that certain
members of the audience will not laugh, to give them
up at once. As long as you are on the platform there
is hope.</p>

<p>I was once lecturing in the chief town of a great
hunting center in England. On the first row sat half
a dozen hair-parted-in-the-middle, single-eye-glass
young swells. They stared at me unmoved, and
never relaxed a muscle except for yawning. It was
most distressing to see how the poor fellows looked
bored. How I did wish I could do something for
them! I had spoken for nearly an hour when, by accident,
I upset the tumbler on my table. The water
trickled down the cloth. The young men laughed,
roared. They were happy and enjoying themselves,
and I had &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; them at last. I have never forgotten
this trick, and when I see in the audience an
apparently hopeless case, I often resort to it, generally
with success.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>There are other people who do not much enjoy
your lecture: your own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:600px; height:278px" src="images/img056.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CHAPPIES WHO WOULD NOT LAUGH.</p></div>

<p>Of course you must forgive your wife. The dear
creature knows all your lectures by heart; she has
heard your jokes hundreds of times. She comes to
your lectures rather to see how you are going to be
received than to listen to you. Besides, she feels that
for an hour and a half you do not belong to her.
When she comes with you to the lecture hall, you are
both ushered into the secretary&rsquo;s room. Two or three
minutes before it is time to go on the platform, it is
suggested to her that it is time she should take her
seat among the audience. She looks at the secretary
and recognizes that for an hour and a half her husband
is the property of this official, who is about to hand
him over to the tender mercies of the public. As she
says, &ldquo;Oh, yes, I suppose I must go,&rdquo; she almost feels
like shaking hands with her husband, as Mrs. Baldwin
takes leave of the Professor before he starts on his
aerial trip. But, though she may not laugh, her heart
is with you, and she is busy watching the audience,
ever ready to tell them, &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you think this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
a very good point? Well, then, if you do, why don&rsquo;t
you laugh and cheer?&rdquo; She is part and parcel of
yourself. She is not jealous of your success, for she
is your helpmate, your kind and sound counselor, and
I can assure you that if an audience should fail to be
responsive, it would never enter her head to lay the
blame on her husband; she would feel the most supreme
contempt for &ldquo;that stupid audience that was
unable to appreciate you.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p>But your other own folk! You are no hero to them.
To judge the effect of anything, you must be placed at
a certain distance, and your own folks are too near you.</p>

<p>One afternoon I had given a lecture to a large and
fashionable audience in the South of England. A near
relative of mine, who lived in the neighborhood, was
in the hall. He never smiled. I watched him from
the beginning to the end. When the lecture was
over he came to the little room behind the platform to
take me to his house. As he entered the room I was
settling the money matters with my <i>impresario</i>. I will
let you into the secret. There was fifty-two pounds in
the house, and my share was two-thirds of the gross
receipts, that is about thirty-four pounds. My relative
heard the sum. As we drove along in his dog-cart he
nudged me and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you make thirty-four pounds this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you hear?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Yes, that was my
part of the takings. For a small town I am quite
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you were!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If you
had made thirty-four shillings you would have been
well paid for your work!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span> </p>

<p>Nothing is more true to life than the want of appreciation
the successful man encounters from relatives
and also from former friends. Nothing is more certain
than when a man has lived on terms of perfect
equality and familiarity with a certain set of men, he
can never hope to be anything but &ldquo;plain John&rdquo; to
them, though by his personal efforts he may have obtained
the applause of the public. Did he not rub
shoulders with them for years in the same walk of
life? Why these bravos? What was there in him
more than in them? Even though they may have
gone so far as to single him out as a &ldquo;rather clever
fellow,&rdquo; while he was one of theirs, still the surprise at
the public appreciation is none the less keen, his advance
toward the front an unforgivable offense, and
they are immediately seized with a desire to rush out
in the highways and proclaim that he is only &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo;
and not the &ldquo;John&rdquo; that his admirers think him. I
remember that, in the early years of my life in England,
when I had not the faintest idea of ever writing a book
on John Bull, a young English friend of mine did me
the honor of appreciating highly all my observations
on British life and manners, and for years urged me
hard and often to jot them down to make a book of.
One day the book was finished and appeared in print.
It attracted a good deal of public attention, but no
one was more surprised than this man, who, from a
kind friend, was promptly transformed into the most
severe and unfriendly of my critics, and went about
saying that the book and the amount of public attention
bestowed upon it were both equally ridiculous.
He has never spoken to me since.

<p class="caption">THE MAN WHO LAUGHS.</p></div>

<p>A successful man is very often charged with wishing
to turn his back on his former friends. No accusation
is more false. Nothing would please him more than
to retain the friends of more modest times, but it
is they who have changed their feelings. They snub
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
him, and this man, who is in constant need of moral
support and <i>pick-me-up</i>, cannot stand it.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>But let us return to the audience.</p>

<p>The man who won&rsquo;t smile is not the only person
who causes you some annoyance.</p>

<p>There is the one who laughs too soon; who laughs
before you have made your points, and who thinks,
because you have opened your lecture with a joke,
that everything you say afterward is a joke. There is
another rather objectionable person; it is the one
who explains your points to his neighbor, and makes
them laugh aloud just at the moment when you require
complete silence to fire off one of your best
remarks.</p>

<p>There is the old lady who listens to you frowning,
and who does not mind what you are saying, but is all
the time shaking for fear of what you are going to say
next. She never laughs before she has seen other
people laugh. Then she thinks she is safe.</p>

<p>All these I am going to have in America again; that
is clear. But I am now a man of experience. I have
lectured in concert rooms, in lecture halls, in theaters,
in churches, in schools. I have addressed embalmed
Britons in English health resorts, petrified English
mummies at hydropathic establishments, and lunatics
in private asylums.</p>

<p>I am ready for the fray.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="tt1">A Connecticut Audience&mdash;Merry Meriden&mdash;A
Hard Pull.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>From Meriden</i>, <i>January</i> 8.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">A Connecticut</span> audience was a new experience
to me. Yesterday I had a crowded room
at the Opera House in Meriden; but if you had been
behind the scenery, when I made my appearance on
the stage, you would not have suspected it, for not
one of the audience treated me to a little applause. I
was frozen, and so were they. For a quarter of an
hour I proceeded very cautiously, feeling the ground,
as it were, as I went on. By that time, the thaw set
in, and they began to smile. I must say that they had
been very attentive from the beginning, and seemed
very interested in the lecture. Encouraged by this, I
warmed too. It was curious to watch that audience.
By twos and threes the faces lit up with amusement
till, by and by, the house wore quite an animated
aspect. Presently there was a laugh, then two, then
laughter more general. All the ice was gone. Next,
a bold spirit in the stalls ventured some applause. At
his second outburst he had company. The uphill
work was nearly over now, and I began to feel better.
The infection spread up to the circles and the gallery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
and at last there came a real good hearty round of
applause. I had &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; them after all. But it
was tough work. When once I had them in hand, I
took good care not to let them go.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I visited several interesting establishments this
morning. Merry Meriden is famous for its manufactories
of electro-plated silverware. Unfortunately I am
not yet accustomed to the heated rooms of America,
and I could not stay in the show-rooms more than a
few minutes. I should have thought the heat was
strong enough to melt all the goods on view. This
town looks like a bee-hive of activity, with its animated
streets, its electric cars. Dear old Europe! With the
exception of a few large cities, the cars are still drawn
by horses, like in the time of Sesostris and Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>On arriving at the station a man took hold of my
bag and asked to take care of it until the arrival of the
train. I do not know whether he belonged to the
hotel where I spent the night, or to the railroad company.
Whatever he was, I felt grateful for this wonderful
show of courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you last night at the Opera House,&rdquo; he
said to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, were you at the lecture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and I greatly enjoyed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you laugh sooner?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to very much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:301px; height:610px" src="images/img063.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;I WAS AT YOUR LECTURE LAST NIGHT.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t very well laugh before the
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you give the signal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are in Connecticut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is laughter prohibited by the Statute Book in
Connecticut?&rdquo; I remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, but if you all laugh at the same time,
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, nobody can tell who is the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train arrived. I shook hands with my friend,
after offering him half a dollar for holding my bag&mdash;which
he refused&mdash;and went on board.</p>

<p>In the parlor car, I met my kind friend Colonel
Charles H. Taylor, editor of that very successful paper,
the Boston <i>Globe</i>. We had luncheon together in the
dining car, and time passed delightfully in his company
till we reached the Grand Central station, New
York, when we parted. He was kind enough to make
me promise to look him up in Boston in a fortnight&rsquo;s
time, when I make my second appearance in the City
of Culture.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="tt">A Tempting Offer&mdash;The Thursday Club&mdash;Bill
Nye&mdash;Visit to Young Ladies&rsquo; Schools&mdash;The
Players&rsquo; Club.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>January</i> 9.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">On</span> returning here, I found a most curious letter
awaiting me. I must tell you that in Boston,
last Monday, I made the following remarks in my
lecture:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The American is, I believe, on the road to the
possession of all that can contribute to the well-being
and success of a nation, but he seems to me to have
missed the path that leads to real happiness. To live
in a whirl is not to live well. The little French shopkeeper
who locks his shop-door from half-past one, so
as not to be disturbed while he is having his dinner
with his wife and family, has come nearer to solving
the great problem of life, &lsquo;How to be happy,&rsquo; than the
American who sticks on his door: &lsquo;Gone to dinner,
shall be back in five minutes.&rsquo; You eat too fast, and I
understand why your antidyspeptic pill-makers cover
your walls, your forests even, with their advertisements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I named the firm of pill-makers.</p>

<p>The letter is from them. They offer me $1000 if I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
will repeat the phrase at every lecture I give during
my tour in the United States.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:383px; height:430px" src="images/img066.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WHERE INDIGESTION IS MANUFACTURED.</p></div>

<p>You may imagine if I will be careful to abstain in
the future.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I lectured to-night before the members of the
Thursday Club&mdash;a small, but very select audience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
gathered in the drawing-room of one of the members.
The lecture was followed by a <i>conversazione</i>. A very
pleasant evening.</p>

<p>I left the house at half-past eleven. The night
was beautiful. I walked to the hotel, along Fifth
Avenue to Madison Square, and along Broadway to
Union Square.</p>

<p>What a contrast to the great thoroughfares of London!
Thousands of people here returning from the
theaters and enjoying their walks, instead of being
obliged to rush into vehicles to escape the sights presented
at night by the West End streets of London.
Here you can walk at night with your wife and
daughter, without the least fear of their coming into
contact with flaunting vice.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Excuse a reflection on a subject of a very domestic
character. My clothes have come from the laundress
with the bill.</p>

<p>Now let me give you a sound piece of advice.</p>

<p>When you go to America, bring with you a dozen
shirts. No more. When these are soiled, buy a
new dozen, and so on. You will thus get a supply
of linen for many years to come, and save your washing
bills in America, where the price of a shirt is
much the same as the cost of washing it.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>January</i> 10.</p>

<p>I was glad to see Bill Nye again. He turned up
at the Everett House this morning. I like to gaze
at his clean-shaven face, that is seldom broken by a
smile, and to hear his long, melancholy drawl. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
lank form, and his polished dome of thought, as he
delights in calling his joke box, help to make him so
droll on the platform. When his audience begins to
scream with laughter, he stops, looks at them in
astonishment; the corners of his mouth drop and an
expression of sadness comes over his face. The effect
is irresistible. They shriek for mercy. But they
don&rsquo;t get it. He is accompanied by his own manager,
who starts with him for the north to-night.
This manager has no sinecure. I don&rsquo;t think Bill
Nye has ever been found in a depot ready to catch a
train. So the manager takes him to the station, puts
him in the right car, gets him out of his sleeping
berth, takes him to the hotel, sees that he is behind
the platform a few minutes before the time announced
for the beginning of the lecture, and generally looks
after his comfort. Bill is due in Ohio to-morrow
night, and leaves New York to-night by the Grand
Central Depot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s by the Grand Central?&rdquo; he said
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, corner of Forty-second Street, a
five or ten minutes&rsquo; ride from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You should have seen the expression on his face, as
he drawled away:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;shall&mdash;I&mdash;get&mdash;there, I&mdash;wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>This afternoon I paid a most interesting visit to
several girls&rsquo; schools. The pupils were ordered by
the head-mistress, in each case, to gather in the large
room. There they arrived, two by two, to the sound
of a march played on the piano by one of the under-mistresses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
When they had all reached their respective
places, two chords were struck on the instrument,
and they all sat down with the precision of the best
drilled Prussian regiment. Then some sang, others
recited little poems, or epigrams&mdash;mostly at the expense
of men. When, two years ago, I visited the
Normal School for girls in the company of the President
of the Education Board and Colonel Elliott F.
Shepard, it was the anniversary of George Eliot&rsquo;s
birth. The pupils, one by one, recited a few quotations
from her works, choosing all she had written
against man.</p>

<p>When the singing and the recitations were over, the
mistress requested me to address a few words to the
young ladies. An American is used from infancy to
deliver a speech on the least provocation. I am not.
However, I managed to congratulate these young
American girls on their charming appearance, and to
thank them for the pleasure they had afforded me.
Then two chords were struck on the piano and all
stood up; two more chords, and all marched off in
double file to the sound of another march. Not a
smile, not a giggle. All these young girls, from sixteen
to twenty, looked at me with modesty, but complete
self-assurance, certainly with far more assurance
than I dared look at them.</p>

<p>Then the mistress asked me to go to the gymnasium.
There the girls arrived and, as solemnly as before,
went through all kinds of muscular exercises.
They are never allowed to sit down in the class rooms
more than two hours at a time. They have to go
down to the gymnasium every two hours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span> </p>

<p>I was perfectly amazed to see such discipline.
These young girls are the true daughters of a great Republic:
self-possessed, self-confident, dignified, respectful,
law-abiding.</p>

<p>I also visited the junior departments of those schools.
In one of them, eight hundred little girls from five to
ten years of age were gathered together, and, as in the
other departments, sang and recited to me. These
young children are taught by the girls of the Normal
School, under the supervision of mistresses. Here
teaching is learned by teaching. A good method.
Doctors are not allowed to practice before they have
attended patients in hospitals. Why should people be
allowed to teach before they have attended schools as
apprentice teachers?</p>

<p>I had to give a speech to these dear little ones. I
wish I had been able to give them a kiss instead.</p>

<p>In my little speech I had occasion to remark that I
had arrived in America only a week before. After I
left, it appears that a little girl, aged about six, went to
her mistress and said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only been here a week! And how beautifully
he speaks English already!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I have been &ldquo;put up&rdquo; at the Players&rsquo; Club by Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman, and dined with him there
to-night.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:341px; height:430px" src="images/img071.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFULLY HE SPEAKS ENGLISH.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This club is the snuggest house I know in New
York. Only a few months old, it possesses treasures
such as few clubs a hundred years old possess. It
was a present from Mr. Edwin Booth, the greatest
actor America has produced. He bought the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
in Twentieth Street, facing Gramercy Park, furnished
it handsomely and with the greatest taste, and filled it
with all the artistic treasures that he has collected during
his life: portraits of celebrated actors, most valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
old engravings, photographs with the originals&rsquo;
autographs, china, curios of all sorts, stage properties,
such as the sword used by Macready in <i>Macbeth</i>, and
hundreds of such beautiful and interesting souvenirs.
On the second floor is the library, mostly composed
of works connected with the drama.</p>

<p>This club is a perfect gem.</p>

<p>When in New York, Mr. Booth occupies a suite of
rooms on the second floor, which he has reserved for
himself; but he has handed over the property to the
trustees of the club, who, after his death, will become
the sole proprietors of the house and of all its priceless
contents. It was a princely gift, worthy of the prince
of actors. The members are all connected with literature,
art, and the drama, and number about one hundred.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="tt">The Flourishing of Coats-of-Arms in America&mdash;Reflections
Thereon&mdash;Forefathers Made
to Order&mdash;The Phonograph at Home&mdash;The
Wealth of New York&mdash;Departure for
Buffalo.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>January</i> 11.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">There</span> are in America, as in many other countries
of the world, people who have coats-of-arms,
and whose ancestors had no arms to their coats.</p>

<p>This remark was suggested by the reading of the
following paragraph in the New York <i>World</i> this
morning:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>There is growing in this country the rotten influence of rank,
pride of station, contempt for labor, scorn of poverty, worship of
caste, such as we verily believe is growing in no country in the
world. What are the ideals that fill so large a part of the day and
generation? For the boy it is riches; for the girl the marrying of
a title. The ideal of this time in America is vast riches and the
trappings of rank. It is good that proper scorn should be
expressed of such ideals.</p></div>

<p>American novelists, journalists, and preachers are
constantly upbraiding and ridiculing their countrywomen
for their love of titled foreigners; but the
society women of the great Republic only love the
foreign lords all the more; and I have heard some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
them openly express their contempt of a form of government
whose motto is one of the clauses of the
great Declaration of Independence: &ldquo;All men are created
equal.&rdquo; I really believe that if the society
women of America had their own way, they would
set up a monarchy to-morrow, in the hope of seeing an
aristocracy established as the sequel of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:432px; height:350px" src="images/img074.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A TITLE.</p></div>

<p>President Garfield once said that the only real coats-of-arms
in America were shirt-sleeves. The epigram is
good, but not based on truth, as every epigram should
be. Labor in the States is not honorable for its own
sake, but only if it brings wealth. President Garfield&rsquo;s
epigram &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; the crowd, no doubt, as any smart
democratic or humanitarian utterance will anywhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
whether it be emitted from the platform, the stage,
the pulpit, or the hustings; but if any American
philosopher heard it, he must have smiled.</p>

<p>A New York friend who called on me this morning,
and with whom I had a chat on this subject, assured
me that there is now such a demand in the States for
pedigrees, heraldic insignia, mottoes, and coronets,
that it has created a new industry. He also informed
me that almost every American city has a college of
heraldry, which will provide unbroken lines of ancestors,
and make to order a new line of forefathers &ldquo;of
the most approved pattern, with suitable arms, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Addison&rsquo;s prosperous foundling, who ordered at the
second-hand picture-dealer&rsquo;s &ldquo;a complete set of ancestors,&rdquo;
is, according to my friend, a typical personage
to be met with in the States nowadays.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Bah! after all, every country has her snobs. Why
should America be an exception to the rule? When I
think of the numberless charming people I have met in
this country, I may as well leave it to the Europeans
who have come in contact with American snobs to
speak about them, inasmuch as the subject is not particularly
entertaining.</p>

<p>What amuses me much more here is the effect of
democracy on what we Europeans would call the lower
classes.</p>

<p>A few days ago, in a hotel, I asked a porter if my
trunk had arrived from the station and had been taken
to my room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said majestically; &ldquo;you ask
that gentleman.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span> </p>

<p>The gentleman pointed out to me was the negro
who looks after the luggage in the establishment.</p>

<p>In the papers you may read in the advertisement
columns: &ldquo;Washing
wanted by a lady at
such and such address.&rdquo;</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE NEW YORK CABMAN.</td></tr></table>

<p>The cabman will
ask, &ldquo;If you are the
<i>man</i> as wants a <i>gentleman</i>
to drive him
to the <i>deepo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During an inquiry
concerning the work-house
at Cambridge,
Mass., a witness
spoke of the &ldquo;ladies&rsquo;
cells,&rdquo; as being all that
should be desired.</p>

<p>Democracy, such
is thy handiwork!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I went to the Stock Exchange in Wall Street at one
o&rsquo;clock. I thought that Whitechapel, on Saturday
night, was beyond competition as a scene of rowdyism.
I have now altered this opinion. I am still wondering
whether I was not guyed by my pilot, and whether I
was not shown the playground of a madhouse, at the
time when all the most desperate lunatics are let
loose.</p>

<p>After lunch I went to Falk&rsquo;s photograph studio to
be taken, and read the first page of &ldquo;Jonathan and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
His Continent,&rdquo; into his phonograph. Marvelous, this
phonograph! I imagine Mr. Falk has the best collection
of cylinders in the world. I heard a song by
Patti, the piano played by Von Bülow, speeches, orchestras,
and what not! The music is reproduced most
faithfully. With the voice the instrument is not quite
so successful. Instead of your own voice, you fancy
you hear an imitation of it by Punch. All the same, it
seems to me to be the wonder of the age.</p>

<p>After paying a few calls, and dining quietly at the
Everett House, I went to the Metropolitan Opera
House, and saw &ldquo;The Barber of Bagdad.&rdquo; Cornelius&rsquo;s
music is Wagnerian in aim, but I did not carry away
with me a single bar of all I heard. After all, this is
perhaps the aim of Wagnerian music.</p>

<p>What a sight is the Metropolitan Opera House, with
its boxes full of lovely women, arrayed in gorgeous
garments, and blazing with diamonds! What luxury!
What wealth is gathered there!</p>

<p>How interesting it would be to know the exact
amount of wealth of which New York can boast! In
this morning&rsquo;s papers I read that land on Fifth Avenue
has lately sold for $115 a square foot. In an acre of
land there are 43,560 square feet, which at $115 a
foot would be $5,009,400 an acre. Just oblige me by
thinking of it!</p>

<p class="rt"><i>January</i> 12.</p>

<p>Went to the Catholic Cathedral at eleven. A mass
by Haydn was splendidly rendered by full orchestra
and admirable chorus. The altar was a blaze of candles.
The yellow of the lights and the plain mauve of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
windows, one on each side of the candles, gave a most
beautiful crocus-bed effect. I enjoyed the service.</p>

<p>In the evening I dined with Mr. Lloyd Bryce, editor
of the <i>North American Review</i>, at the splendid residence
of his father-in-law, Mr. Cooper, late Mayor of
New York. Mrs. Lloyd Bryce is one of the handsomest
American women I have met, and a most
charming and graceful hostess. I reluctantly left
early so as to prepare for my night journey to
Buffalo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="tt1">Different Ways of Advertising a Lecture&mdash;American
Impresarios and Their Methods.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Buffalo</i>, <i>January</i> 13.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">When</span> you intend to give a lecture anywhere,
and you wish it to be a success, it is a mistake
to make a mystery of it.</p>

<p>On arriving here this morning, I found that my coming
had been kept perfectly secret.</p>

<p>Perhaps my impresario wishes my audience to be
very select, and has sent only private circulars to the
intelligent, well-to-do inhabitants of the place&mdash;or, I
said to myself, perhaps the house is all sold, and he has
no need of any further advertisements.</p>

<p>I should very much like to know.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, it is a mistake to advertise a
lecture too widely. You run the risk of getting the
wrong people.</p>

<p>A few years ago, in Dundee, a little corner gallery,
placed at the end of the hall where I was to speak, was
thrown open to the public at sixpence. I warned the
manager that I was no attraction for the sixpenny
public; but he insisted on having his own way.</p>

<p>The hall was well filled, but not the little gallery,
where I counted about a dozen people. Two of these,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
however, did not remain long, and, after the lecture, I
was told that they had gone to the box-office and asked
to have their money returned to them. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a d&mdash;&mdash; swindle; it&rsquo;s only a man talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man at the box-office was a Scotchman, and it
will easily be understood that the two sixpences
remained in the hands of the management.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I can well remember how startled I was, two years
ago, on arriving in an American town where I was to
lecture, to see the walls covered with placards announcing
my lecture thus: &ldquo;He is coming, ah, ha!&rdquo; And
after I had arrived, new placards were stuck over the
old ones: &ldquo;He has arrived, ah, ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another American town I was advertised as &ldquo;the
best paying platform celebrity in the world.&rdquo; In
another, in the following way: &ldquo;If you would grow
fat and happy, go and hear Max O&rsquo;Rell to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of my Chicago lectures was advertised thus:
&ldquo;Laughter is restful. If you desire to feel as though
you had a vacation for a week, do not fail to attend
this lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was once fortunate enough to deal with a local
manager who, before sending it to the newspapers,
submitted to my approbation the following advertisement,
of which he was very proud. I don&rsquo;t know
whether it was his own literary production, or whether
he had borrowed it of a showman friend. Here it is:</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">Two Hours of Unalloyed Fun and Happiness</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Will put two inches of solid fat even upon the ribs of the most
cadaverous old miser. Everybody shouts peals of laughter as the
rays of fun are emitted from this famous son of merry-makers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span></p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:367px; height:610px" src="images/img081.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AS JOHN BULL.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span> </p>

<p>I threatened to refuse to appear if the advertisement
was inserted in the papers. This manager later
gave his opinion that, as a lecturer, I was good, but
that as a man, I was a little bit &ldquo;stuck-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When you arrive in an American town to lecture,
you find the place flooded with your pictures, huge
lithographs stuck on the walls, on the shop windows,
in your very hotel entrance hall. Your own face
stares at you everywhere, you are recognized by
everybody. You have to put up with it. If you love
privacy, peace, and quiet, don&rsquo;t go to America on a
lecturing tour. That is what your impresario will tell
you.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In each town where you go, you have a local manager
to &ldquo;boss the show&rdquo;; as he has to pay you a certain
fee, which he guarantees, you cannot find fault
with him for doing his best to have a large audience.
He runs risks; you do not. Suppose, for instance,
you are engaged, not by a society for a fee, but by a
manager on sharing terms, say sixty per cent. of the
gross receipts for you and forty for himself. Suppose
his local expenses amount to $200; he has to bring
$500 into the house before there is a cent for himself.
You must forgive him if he goes about the place beating
the big drum. If you do not like it, there is a
place where you can stay&mdash;home.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>An impresario once asked me if I required a piano,
and if I would bring my own accompanist. Another
wrote to ask the subject of my &ldquo;entertainment.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:433px; height:610px" src="images/img083.jpg" alt="" />

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:202px; height:200px" src="images/img084.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">AS PAT.</td></tr></table>

<p>I wrote back to say that my lecture was generally
found entertaining, but that I objected to its being
called an entertainment.
I added that
the lecture was composed
of four character
sketches, viz., John
Bull, Sandy, Pat, and
Jonathan.</p>

<p>In his answer to this,
he inquired whether I
should change my dress
four times during the
performance, and
whether it would not
be a good thing to have a little music during the
intervals.</p>

<p>Just fancy my appearing on the platform successively
dressed as John, Sandy, Pat, and Jonathan!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>A good impresario is constantly on the look out for
anything that may draw the attention of the public to
his entertainment. Nothing is sacred for him. His
eyes and ears are always open, all his senses on the alert.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was walking with my impresario
over the beautiful Clifton Suspension Bridge. I was
to lecture at the Victoria Hall, Bristol, in the evening.
We leaned on the railings, and grew pensive as we
looked at the scenery and the abyss under us.</p>

<p>My impresario sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; I said to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">AS JONATHAN.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Last year,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;a girl tried to commit suicide
and jumped over this bridge; but the wind got
under her skirt, made a parachute of it, and she
descended to the bottom of the valley perfectly unhurt.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:423px; height:430px" src="images/img086.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE WOULD-BE SUICIDE.</p></div>

<p>And he sighed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why do you sigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear fellow, if you could do the same this
afternoon, there would be &lsquo;standing room only&rsquo; in the
Victoria Hall to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I left that bridge in no time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="tt">Buffalo&mdash;The Niagara Falls&mdash;A Frost&mdash;Rochester
to the Rescue of Buffalo&mdash;Cleveland&mdash;I
Meet Jonathan&mdash;Phantasmagoria.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Buffalo</i>, <i>January</i> 14.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">This</span> town is situated twenty-seven miles from
Niagara Falls. The Americans say that the
Buffalo people can hear the noise of the water-fall
quite distinctly. I am quite prepared to believe it.
However, an hour&rsquo;s journey by rail and then a quarter
of an hour&rsquo;s sleigh ride will take you from Buffalo
within sight of this, perhaps the grandest piece of
scenery in the world. Words cannot describe it. You
spend a couple of hours visiting every point of view.
You are nailed, as it were, to the ground, feeling like
a pigmy, awestruck in the presence of nature at her
grandest. The snow was falling thickly, and though
it made the view less clear, it added to the grandeur of
the scene.</p>

<p>I went down by the cable car to a level with the rapids
and the place where poor Captain Webb was last seen
alive; a presumptuous pigmy, he, to dare such waters
as these. His widow keeps a little bazaar near the
falls and sells souvenirs to the visitors.</p>

<p>It was most thrilling to stand within touching distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
of that great torrent of water, called the Niagara
Falls, in distinction to the Horseshoe Falls, to
hear the roar of it as it fell. The idea of force it gives
one is tremendous. You stand and wonder how many
ages it has been roaring on, what eyes besides your
own have gazed awestruck at its mighty rushing, and
wonder if the pigmies will ever do what they say
they will; one day make those columns of water
their servants to turn wheels at their bidding.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:469px; height:430px" src="images/img088.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHOOTING THE RAPIDS.</p></div>

<p>We crossed the bridge over to the Canadian side,
and there we had the whole grand panorama before
our eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span> </p>

<p>It appears that it is quite a feasible thing to run the
rapids in a barrel. Girls have done it, and it may become
the fashionable sport for American girls in the
near future. It has been safely accomplished plenty of
times by young fellows up for an exciting day&rsquo;s sport.</p>

<p>On the Canadian shore was a pretty villa where
Princess Louise stayed while she painted the scene.
Some of the pretty houses were fringed all round the
roofs and balconies in the loveliest way, with icicles a
yard long, and loaded with snow. They looked most
beautiful.</p>

<p>On the way back we called at Prospect House, a
charming hotel which I hope, if ever I go near Buffalo
again, I shall put up at for a day or two, to see the
neighborhood well.</p>

<p>Two years ago I was lucky enough to witness a
most curious sight. The water was frozen under the
falls, and a natural bridge, formed by the ice, was being
used by venturesome people to cross the Niagara
River on. This occurs very seldom.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I have had a fizzle to-night. I almost expected it.
In a hall that could easily have accommodated fifteen
hundred people, I lectured to an audience of about
three hundred. Fortunately they proved so intelligent,
warm, and appreciative that I did not feel at all
depressed; but my impresario did. However, he congratulated
me on having been able to do justice to the
<i>causerie</i>, as if I had had a bumper house.</p>

<p>I must own that it is much easier to be a tragedian
than a light comedian before a $200 house.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span> </p>

<p class="rt"><i>Cleveland, O.</i>, <i>January</i> 15.</p>

<p>The weather is so bad that I shall be unable to see
anything of this city, which, people tell me, is very
beautiful.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Weddell House, I met a New
York friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how are you getting on? Where
do you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Buffalo,&rdquo; said I, pulling a long face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Don&rsquo;t you like the Buffalo
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I liked those I saw. I should have liked to
extend my love to a larger number. I had a fizzle;
about three hundred people. Perhaps I drew all the
brain of Buffalo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many people do you say you had in the
hall?&rdquo; said my friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About three hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must have drawn a good many people
from Rochester, I should think,&rdquo; said he quite solemnly.</p>

<p>In reading the Buffalo newspapers this morning, I
noticed favorable criticisms of my lecture; but while
my English was praised, so far as the language went,
severe comments were passed on my pronunciation.
In England, where the English language is spoken
with a decent pronunciation, I never once read a condemnation
of my pronunciation of the English language.</p>

<p>I will not appear again in Buffalo until I feel much
improved.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;GOING TO PITTSBURG, I GUESS.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="rt"><i>En route to Pittsburg</i>, <i>January</i> 16.</p>

<p>The American railway stations have special waiting
rooms for ladies&mdash;not, as in England, places furnished
with looking-glasses, where they can go and arrange
their bonnets, etc. No, no. Places where they can
wait for the trains, protected against the contamination
of man, and where they are spared the sight
of that eternal little round piece of furniture with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
which the floors of the whole of the United States
are dotted.</p>

<p>At Cleveland Station, this morning, I met Jonathan,
such as he is represented in the comic papers of the
world. A man of sixty, with long straight white hair
falling over his shoulders; no mustache, long imperial
beard, a razor-blade-shaped nose, small keen eyes, and
high prominent cheek-bones, the whole smoking the
traditional cigar; the Anglo-Saxon indianized&mdash;Jonathan.
If he had had a long swallow-tail coat on, a
waistcoat ornamented with stars, and trowsers with
stripes, he might have sat for the cartoons of <i>Puck</i> or
<i>Judge</i>.</p>

<p>In the car, Jonathan came and sat opposite me.
A few minutes after the train had started, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to Pittsburg, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To lecture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know I lecture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly; I heard you in Boston ten days
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He offered me a cigar, told me his name&mdash;I mean
his three names&mdash;what he did, how much he earned,
where he lived, how many children he had; he read
me a poem of his own composition, invited me to go
and see him, and entertained me for three hours and a
half, telling me the history of his life, etc. Indeed, it
was Jonathan.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>All the Americans I have met have written a poem
(pronounced <i>pome</i>). Now I am not generalizing. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
do not say that all the Americans have written a poem,
I say <i>all the Americans I have met</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Pittsburg</i> (<i>same day later</i>).</p>

<p>I lecture here to-night under the auspices of the
Press Club of the town. The president of the club
came to meet me at the station, in order to show me
something of the town.</p>

<p>I like Pittsburg very much. From the top of the
hill, which you reach in a couple of minutes by the cable
car, there is a most beautiful sight to contemplate:
one never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>On our way to the hotel, my kind friend took me to
a fire station, and asked the man in command of the
place to go through the performance of a fire-call for
my own edification.</p>

<p>Now, in two words, here is the thing.</p>

<p>You touch the fire bell in your own house. That
causes the name of your street and the number of your
house to appear in the fire station; it causes all the
doors of the station to open outward. Wait a minute&mdash;it
causes whips which are hanging behind the
horses, to lash them and send them under harnesses
that fall upon them and are self-adjusting; it causes
the men, who are lying down on the first floor, to slide
down an incline and fall on the box and steps of the
cart. And off they gallop. It takes about two minutes
to describe it as quickly as possible. It only takes
fourteen seconds to do it. It is the nearest approach
to phantasmagoria that I have yet seen in real life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="tt">A Great Admirer&mdash;Notes on Railway Traveling&mdash;Is
America a Free Nation?&mdash;A Pleasant
Evening in New York.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>In the vestibule train from Pittsburg to New York</i>,
<i>January</i> 17.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">This</span> morning, before leaving the hotel in Pittsburg,
I was approached by a young man who,
after giving me his card, thanked me most earnestly
for my lecture of last night. In fact, he nearly embraced
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never enjoyed myself so much in my life,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>I grasped his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that my humble effort
pleased you so much. Nothing is more gratifying to
a lecturer than to know he has afforded pleasure to his
audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it gave me immense pleasure.
You see, I am engaged to be married to a girl in town.
All her family went to your show, and I had the girl
at home all to myself. Oh! I had such a good time!
Thank you so much! Do lecture here again soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, after wishing me a pleasant journey, he left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
me. I was glad to know I left at least one friend and
admirer behind me in Pittsburg.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I had a charming audience last night, a large and
most appreciative one. I was introduced by Mr.
George H. Welshons, of the Pittsburg <i>Times</i>, in a neat
little speech, humorous and very gracefully worded.
After the lecture, I was entertained at supper in the
rooms of the Press Club, and thoroughly enjoyed myself
with the members. As I entered the Club, I was
amused to see two journalists, who had heard me at
the lecture discourse on chewing, go to a corner of the
room, and there get rid of their <i>wads</i>, before coming
to shake hands with me.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>If you have not journeyed in a vestibule train of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, you do not know
what it is to travel in luxurious comfort. Dining
saloon, drawing room, smoking room, reading room
with writing tables, supplied with the papers and a
library of books, all furnished with exquisite taste and
luxury. The cookery is good and well served.</p>

<p>The day has passed without adventures, but in comfort.
We left Pittsburg at seven in the morning. At
nine we passed Johnstown. The terrible calamity that
befell that city two years ago was before my mind&rsquo;s
eye; the town suddenly inundated, the people rushing
on the bridge, and there caught and burnt alive.
America is the country for great disasters. Everything
here is on a huge scale. Toward noon, the
country grew hilly, and, for an hour before we reached
Harrisburg, it gave me great enjoyment, for in America,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
where there is so much sameness in the landscapes,
it is a treat to see the mountains of Central
Pennsylvania breaking the monotony of the huge flat
stretch of land.</p>

<p>The employees (I must be careful not to say &ldquo;servants&rdquo;)
of the Pennsylvania Railroad are polite and
form an agreeable contrast to those of the other railway
companies. Unhappily, the employees whom
you find on board the Pullman cars are not in the control
of the company.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The train will reach Jersey City for New York at
seven to-night. I shall dine at my hotel.</p>

<p>About 5.30 it occurred to me to go to the dining-room
car and ask for a cup of tea. Before entering
the car I stopped at the lavatory to wash my hands.
Some one was using the basin. It was the conductor,
the autocrat in charge of the dining car, a fat, sleek,
chewing, surly, frowning, snarling cur.</p>

<p>He turned round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should very much like to wash my hands,&rdquo; I
timidly ventured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see very well I am using the basin. You go
to the next car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I came to America this time with a large provision
of philosophy, and quite determined to even enjoy
such little scenes as this. So I quietly went to the
next lavatory, returned to the dining-car, and sat down
at one of the tables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you, please, give me a cup of tea?&rdquo; I said to
one of the colored waiters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do dat, sah,&rdquo; said the negro. &ldquo;You can have
dinnah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want <i>dinnah</i>,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I want a cup
of tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den you must ask dat gem&rsquo;man if you can have
it,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the above mentioned &ldquo;gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are you the nobleman who
runs this show?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to dine; I should like to have a cup
of tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned a little more, and deigned to hear my
request to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; I repeated.</p>

<p>He spoke not; he brought his eyebrows still lower
down, and solemnly shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I really?&rdquo; I continued.</p>

<p>At last he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;for a dollar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, taking the bill of fare in his hands, without
wasting any more of his precious utterances, he pointed
out to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each meal one dollar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The argument was unanswerable.</p>

<p>I went back to my own car, resumed my seat, and
betook myself to reflection.</p>

<p>What I cannot, for the life of me, understand is
why, in a train which has a dining car and a kitchen, a
man cannot be served with a cup of tea, unless he pays
the price of a dinner for it, and this notwithstanding
the fact of his having paid five dollars extra to enjoy
the extra luxury of this famous vestibule train.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
After all, this is one out of the many illustrations
one could give to show that whatever Jonathan is, he
is not the master in his own house.</p>

<p>The Americans are the most docile people in the
world. They are the slaves of their servants, whether
these are high officials, or the &ldquo;reduced duchesses&rdquo; of
domestic service. They are so submitted to their lot
that they seem to find it quite natural.</p>

<p>The Americans are lions governed by bull-dogs and
asses.</p>

<p>They have given themselves a hundred thousand
masters, these folks who laugh at monarchies, for
example, and scorn the rule of a king, as if it were
better to be bullied by a crowd than by an individual.</p>

<p>In America, the man who pays does not command
the paid. I have already said it; I will maintain the
truth of the statement that, in America, the paid servant
rules. Tyranny from above is bad; tyranny from
below is worse.</p>

<p>Of my many first impressions that have deepened into
convictions, this is one of the firmest.</p>

<p>When you arrive at an English railway station, all
the porters seem to say: &ldquo;Here is a customer, let us
treat him well.&rdquo; And it is who shall relieve you of
your luggage, or answer any questions you may be
pleased to ask. They are glad to see you.</p>

<p>In America, you may have a dozen parcels, not a
hand will move to help you with them. So Jonathan
is obliged to forego the luxury of hand baggage, so
convenient for long journeys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span> </p>

<p>When you arrive at an American station, the officials
are all frowning and seem to say: &ldquo;Why the deuce
don&rsquo;t you go to Chicago by some other line instead of
coming here to bother us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This subject reminds me of an interesting fact, told
me by Mr. Chauncey M. Depew on board the <i>Teutonic</i>.
When tram-cars were first used in the States, it was a
long time before the drivers and conductors would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
consent to wear any kind of uniform, so great is the
horror of anything like a badge of paid servitude.
Now that they do wear
some kind of uniform,
they spend their time
in standing sentry at
the door of their dignity,
and in thinking
that, if they were polite,
you would take
their affable manners
for servility.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Everett House, New York.</i> (<i>Midnight.</i>)</p>

<p>So many charming
houses have opened
their hospitable doors
to me in New York
that, when I am in
this city, I have soon
forgotten the little annoyances
of a railway journey or the hardships of a
lecture tour.</p>

<p>After dining here, I went to spend the evening at
the house of Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, the poet, and
editor of the <i>Century Magazine</i>, that most successful
of all magazines in the world. A circulation of
nearly 300,000 copies&mdash;just think of it! But it need
not excite wonder in any one who knows this beautiful
and artistic periodical, to which all the leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
<i>littérateurs</i> of America lend their pens, and the best
artists their pencils.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richard Watson Gilder is one of the best and
most genial hostesses in New York. At her Fridays,
one meets the cream of intellectual society, the best
known names of the American aristocracy of talent.</p>

<p>To-night I met Mr. Frank R. Stockton, the novelist,
Mr. Charles Webb, the humorist, Mr. Frank Millet,
the painter, and his wife, and a galaxy of celebrities
and beautiful women, all most interesting and
delightful people to meet. Conversation went on
briskly all over the rooms till late.</p>

<p>The more I see of the American women, the more
confirmed I become in my impression that they are
typical; more so than the men. They are like no
other women I know. The brilliancy of their conversation,
the animation of their features, the absence
of affectation in their manners, make them unique.
There are no women to compare to them in a drawing-room.
There are none with whom I feel so much at
ease. Their beauty, physically speaking, is great;
but you are still more struck by their intellectual
beauty, the frankness of their eyes, and the naturalness
of their bearing.</p>

<p>I returned to the Everett House, musing all the way
on the difference between the American women and
the women of France and England. The theme was
attractive, and, remembering that to-morrow would be
an off-day for me, I resolved to spend it in going more
fully into this fascinating subject with pen and ink.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="tt">Notes on American Women&mdash;Comparisons&mdash;How
Men Treat Women and Vice Versa&mdash;Scenes
and Illustrations.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>January</i> 18.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">A man</span> was one day complaining to a friend that
he had been married twenty years without being
able to understand his wife. &ldquo;You should not complain
of that,&rdquo; remarked the friend. &ldquo;I have been married
to my wife two years only, and I understand her
perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leaders of thought in France have long ago proclaimed
that woman was the only problem it was not
given to man to solve. They have all tried, and they
have all failed. They all acknowledge it&mdash;but they
are trying still.</p>

<p>Indeed, the interest that woman inspires in every
Frenchman is never exhausted. Parodying Terence,
he says to himself, &ldquo;I am a man, and all that concerns
woman interests me.&rdquo; All the French modern novels
are studies, analytical, dissecting studies, of woman&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p>To the Anglo-Saxon mind, this may sometimes appear
a trifle puerile, if not also ridiculous. But to understand
this feeling, one must remember how a
Frenchman is brought up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span> </p>

<p>In England, boys and girls meet and play together;
in America and Canada, they sit side by side on the
same benches at school, not only as children of tender
age, but at College and in the Universities. They get
accustomed to each other&rsquo;s company; they see nothing
strange in being in contact with one another, and
this naturally tends to reduce the interest or curiosity
one sex takes in the other. But in France they are
apart, and the ball-room is the only place where they
can meet when they have attained the age of twenty!</p>

<p>Strange to reflect that young people of both sexes
can meet in ball-rooms without exciting their
parents&rsquo; suspicions, and that they cannot do so in
class-rooms!</p>

<p>When I was a boy at school in France, I can well remember
how we boys felt on the subject. If we heard
that a young girl, say the sister of some school-fellow,
was with her mother in the common parlor to see her
brother, why, it created a commotion, a perfect revolution
in the whole establishment. It was no use trying
to keep us in order. We would climb on the top
of the seats or of the tables to endeavor to see something
of her, even if it were but the top of her hat, or
a bit of her gown across the recreation yard at the very
end of the building. It was an event. Many of us
would even immediately get inspired and compose
verses addressed to the unknown fair visitor. In these
poetical effusions we would imagine the young girl
carried off by some miscreant, and we would fly to her
rescue, save her, and throw ourselves at her feet to receive
her hand as our reward. Yes, we would get quite
romantic or, in plain English, quite silly. We could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
not imagine that a woman was a reasoning being with
whom you can talk on the topics of the day, or have
an ordinary conversation on any ordinary subject. To
us a woman was a being with whom you can only talk
of love, or fall in love, or, maybe, for whom you may
die of love.</p>

<p>This manner of training young men goes a long way
toward explaining the position of woman in France as
well as her ways. It explains why a Frenchman and
a Frenchwoman, when they converse together, seldom
can forget that one is a man and the other a woman.
It does not prove that a Frenchwoman must necessarily
be, and is, affected in her relations with men;
but it explains why she does not feel, as the American
woman does, that a man and woman can enjoy a <i>tête-à-tête</i>
free from all those commonplace flatteries, compliments,
and platitudes that badly-understood gallantry
suggests. Many American ladies have made me forget,
by the easiness of their manner and the charm and
naturalness of their conversation, that I was speaking
with women, and with lovely ones, too. This I
could never have forgotten in the company of French
ladies.</p>

<p>On account of this feeling, and perhaps also of the
difference which exists between the education received
by a man and that received by a woman in France,
the conversation will always be on some light topics,
literary, artistic, dramatic, social, or other. Indeed, it
would be most unbecoming for a man to start a very
serious subject of conversation with a French lady to
whom he had just been introduced. He would be
taken for a pedant or a man of bad breeding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span> </p>

<p>In America, men and women receive practically
the same education, and this of course enlarges the
circle of conversation between the sexes. I shall
always remember a beautiful American girl, not more
than twenty years of age, to whom I was once introduced
in New York, as she was giving to a lady sitting
next to her a most detailed description of the latest
bonnet invented in Paris, and who, turning toward me,
asked me point-blank if I had read M. Ernest Renan&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of the People of Israel.&rdquo; I had to confess
that I had not yet had time to read it. But she had,
and she gave me, without the remotest touch of affectation
or pedantry, a most interesting and learned
analysis of that remarkable work. I related this incident
in &ldquo;Jonathan and his Continent.&rdquo; On reading
it, some of my countrymen, critics and others, exclaimed:
&ldquo;We imagine the fair American girl had a
pair of gold spectacles on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear compatriots, nothing of the sort. No
gold spectacles, no guy. It was a beautiful girl,
dressed with most exquisite taste and care, and most
charming and womanly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An American woman, however learned she may be,
is a sound politician, and she knows that the best
thing she can make of herself is a woman, and she remains
a woman. She will always make herself as
attractive as she possibly can. Not to please men&mdash;I
believe she has a great contempt for them&mdash;but to
please herself. If, in a French drawing-room, I were
to remark to a lady how clever some woman in the
room looked, she would probably closely examine that
woman&rsquo;s dress to find out what I thought was wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
about it. It would probably be the same in England,
but not in America.</p>

<p>A Frenchwoman will seldom be jealous of another
woman&rsquo;s cleverness. She will far more readily forgive
her this qualification than beauty. And in this particular
point, it is probable that the Frenchwoman
resembles all the women in the Old World.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Of all the ladies I have met, I have no hesitation in
declaring that the American ones are the least affected.
With them, I repeat it, I feel at ease as I do with no
other women in the world.</p>

<p>With whom but an <i>Américaine</i> would the following
little scene have been possible?</p>

<p>I was in Boston. It was Friday, and knowing it to
be the reception day of Mrs. X., an old friend of mine
and my wife&rsquo;s, I thought I would call upon her early,
before the crowd of visitors had begun to arrive. So I
went to the house about half-past three in the afternoon.
Mrs. X. received me in the drawing-room, and
we were soon talking on the hundred and one topics
that old friends have on their tongue tips. Presently
the conversation fell on love and lovers. Mrs. X.
drew her chair up a little nearer to the fire, put the
toes of her little slippers on the fender stool, and with
a charmingly confidential, but perfectly natural, manner,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are married and love your wife; I am married
and love my husband; we are both artists, let&rsquo;s have
our say out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we proceeded to have our say out.</p>

<p>But all at once I noticed that about half an inch of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
seam of her black silk bodice was unsewn. We men,
when we see a lady with something awry in her toilette,
how often do we long to say to her: &ldquo;Excuse
me, madam, but perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that you
have a hairpin sticking out two inches just behind
your ear,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pardon me, Miss, I&rsquo;m a married man,
there is something wrong there behind, just under
your waist belt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I felt for Mrs. X., who was just going to receive
a crowd of callers with a little rent in one of her bodice
seams, and tried to persuade myself to be brave and
tell her of it. Yet I hesitated. People take things so
differently. The conversation went on unflagging.
At last I could not stand it any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. X.,&rdquo; said I, all in a breath, &ldquo;you are married
and love your husband; I am married and love my
wife; we are both artists; there is a little bit of seam
come unsewn, just there by your arm, run and get it
sewn up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peals of laughter that I heard going on upstairs,
while the damage was being repaired, proved
to me that there was no resentment to be feared, but,
on the contrary, that I had earned the gratitude of
Mrs. X.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In many respects I have often been struck with the
resemblance which exists between French and American
women. When I took my first walk on Broadway,
New York, on a fine afternoon some two years and
a half ago, I can well remember how I exclaimed:
&ldquo;Why, this is Paris, and all these ladies are <i>Parisiennes</i>!&rdquo;
It struck me as being the same type of face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
the same animation of features, the same brightness of
the eyes, the same self-assurance, the same attractive
plumpness in women over thirty. To my mind, I was
having a walk on my own Boulevards (every Parisian
<i>owns</i> that place). The more I became acquainted with
American ladies, the more forcibly this resemblance
struck me. This was not a mere first impression. It
has been, and is still, a deep conviction; so much so
that whenever I returned to New York from a journey
of some weeks in the heart of the country, I felt as if
I was returning home.</p>

<p>After a short time, a still closer resemblance between
the women of the two countries will strike a Frenchman
most forcibly. It is the same <i>finesse</i>, the same
suppleness of mind, the same wonderful adaptability.
Place a little French milliner in a good drawing-room
for an hour, and at the end of that time she will behave,
talk, and walk like any lady in the room. Suppose
an American, married below his <i>status</i> in society,
is elected President of the United States, I believe, at
the end of a week, this wife of his would do the honors
of the White House with the ease and grace of a highborn
lady.</p>

<p>In England it is just the contrary.</p>

<p>Of course good society is good society everywhere.
The ladies of the English aristocracy are perfect
queens; but the Englishwoman, who was not born a
lady, will seldom become a lady, and I believe this is
why <i>mésalliances</i> are more scarce in England than in
America, and especially in France. I could name
many Englishmen at the head of their professions,
who cannot produce their wives in society because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
these women have not been able to raise themselves to
the level of their husbands&rsquo; station in life. The
Englishwoman, as a rule, has no faculty for fitting herself
for a higher position than the one she was born
in; like a rabbit, she will often taste of the cabbage
she fed on. And I am bound to add that this is perhaps
a quality, and proves the truthfulness of her
character. She is no actress.</p>

<p>In France, the <i>mésalliance</i>, though not relished by
parents, is not feared so much, because they know the
young woman will observe and study, and very soon
fit herself for her new position.</p>

<p>And while on this subject of <i>mésalliance</i>, why not
try to destroy an absurd prejudice that exists in almost
every country on the subject of France?</p>

<p>It is, I believe, the firm conviction of foreigners that
Frenchmen marry for money, that is to say, that all
Frenchmen marry for money. As a rule, when people
discuss foreign social topics, they have a wonderful
faculty for generalization.</p>

<p>The fact that many Frenchmen do marry for money
is not to be denied, and the explanation of it is this:
We have in France a number of men belonging to a
class almost unknown in other countries, small <i>bourgeois</i>
of good breeding and genteel habits, but relatively
poor, who occupy posts in the different Government
offices. Their name is legion and their salary
something like two thousand francs ($400). These men
have an appearance to keep up, and, unless a wife
brings them enough to at least double their income,
they cannot marry. These young men are often sought
after by well-to-do parents for their daughters, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
they are steady, cultured, gentlemanly, and occupy an
honorable position, which brings them a pension for
their old age. With the wife&rsquo;s dowry, the couple can
easily get along, and lead a peaceful, uneventful, and
happy jog-trot life, which is the great aim of the
majority of the French people.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, there is no country where
you will see so many cases of <i>mésalliance</i> as France, and
this alone should dispose of the belief that Frenchmen
marry for money. Indeed, it is a most common thing
for a young Frenchman of good family to fall in love
with a girl of a much lower station of life than his own,
to court her, at first with perhaps only the idea of killing
time or of starting a <i>liaison</i>, to soon discover that
the girl is highly respectable, and to finally marry her.
This is a most common occurrence. French parents
frown on this sort of thing, and do their best to discourage
it, of course; but rather than cross their son&rsquo;s
love, they give their consent, and trust to that adaptability
of Frenchwomen, of which I was speaking just
now, to raise herself to her husband&rsquo;s level and make a
wife he will never be ashamed of.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The Frenchman is the slave of his womankind, but
not in the same way as the American is. The Frenchman
is brought up by his mother, and remains under
her sway till she dies. When he marries, his wife
leads him by the nose (an operation which he seems to
enjoy), and when, besides, he has a daughter, on whom
he generally dotes, this lady soon joins the other two
in ruling this easy-going, good-humored man. As a
rule, when you see a Frenchman, you behold a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
who is kept in order by three generations of women:
mother, wife, and daughter.</p>

<p>The American will lavish attention and luxury on
his wife and daughters, but he will save them the
trouble of being mixed in his affairs. His business is
his, his office is private. His womankind is the sun
and glory of his life, whose company he will hasten to
enjoy as soon as he can throw away the cares of his
business. In France, a wife is a partner, a cashier who
takes care of the money, even an adviser on stock and
speculations. In the mercantile class, she is both
cashier and bookkeeper. Enter a shop in France,
Paris included, and behind &ldquo;Pay Here,&rdquo; you will see
Madame, smiling all over as she pockets the money
for the purchase you have made. When I said she
is a partner, I might safely have said that she is the
active partner, and, as a rule, by far the shrewder of
the two. She brings to bear her native suppleness,
her fascinating little ways, her persuasive manners, and
many a customer whom her husband was allowing to go
away without a purchase, has been brought back by the
wife, and induced to part with his cash in the shop.
Last year I went to Paris, on my way home from Germany,
to spend a few days visiting the Exposition.
One day I entered a shop on the Boulevards to buy a
white hat. The new-fashioned hats, the only hats
which the man showed me, were narrow-brimmed, and
I declined to buy one. I was just going to leave,
when the wife, who, from the back parlor, had listened
to my conversation with her husband, stepped in and
said: &ldquo;But, Adolphe, why do you let Monsieur go?
Perhaps he does not care to follow the fashion. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
have a few white broad-brimmed hats left from last
year that we can let Monsieur have <i>à bon compte</i>.
They are upstairs, go and fetch them.&rdquo;  And, sure
enough, there was one which fitted and pleased me, and
I left in that shop a little sum of twenty-five francs,
which the husband was going to let me take elsewhere,
but which the wife managed to secure for the firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span> </p>

<p>No one who has lived in France has failed to be
struck with the intelligence of the women, and there
exist few Frenchmen who do not readily admit how intellectually
inferior they are to their countrywomen,
chiefly among the middle and lower classes. And this
is not due to any special training, for the education received
by the women of that class is of the most limited
kind; they are taught to read, write, and reckon,
and their education is finished. Shrewdness is inborn
in them, as well as a peculiar talent for getting a hundred
cents&rsquo; worth for every dollar they spend. How to
make a house look pretty and attractive with small outlay;
how to make a dress or turn out a bonnet with a
few knick-knacks; how to make a savory dish out of a
small remnant of beef, mutton, and veal; all that is a
science not to be despised when a husband, in receipt
of a four or five hundred dollar salary, wants to make a
good dinner, and see his wife look pretty. No doubt
the aristocratic inhabitants of Mayfair and Belgravia in
London, and the plutocracy of New York, may think
all this very small, and these French people very uninteresting.
They can, perhaps, hardly imagine that such
people may live on such incomes and look decent. But
they do live, and live very happy lives, too. And I
will go so far as to say that happiness, real happiness,
is chiefly found among people of limited income. The
husband, who perhaps for a whole year has put quietly
by a dollar every week, so as to be able to give his
dear wife a nice present at Christmas, gives her a far
more valuable, a far better appreciated present, than
the millionaire who orders Tiffany to send a diamond
<i>rivière</i> to his wife. That quiet young French couple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
whom you see at the upper circle of a theater, and who
have saved the money to enable them to come and hear
such and such a play, are happier than the occupants
of the boxes on
the first tier. If
you doubt it,
take your opera
glasses, and
&ldquo;look on this
picture, and on
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In observing
nations, I have
always taken
more interest in
the &ldquo;million,&rdquo;
who differ in
every country, than in the &ldquo;upper ten,&rdquo; who are alike
all over the world. People who have plenty of money
at their disposal generally discover the same way of
spending it, and adopt the same mode of living.
People who have only a small income show their
native instincts in the intelligent use of it. All these
differ, and these only are worth studying, unless you
belong to the staff of a &ldquo;society&rdquo; paper. (As a
Frenchman, I am glad to say we have no &ldquo;society&rdquo;
papers. England and America are the only two
countries in the world where these official organs of
Anglo-Saxon snobbery can be found, and I should not
be surprised to hear that Australia possessed some of
these already.)</p>

<p>The source of French happiness is to be found in
the thrift of the women, from the best middle class to
the peasantry. This thrift is also the source of French
wealth. A nation is really wealthy when the fortunes
are stable, however small. We have no railway kings,
no oil kings, no silver kings, but we have no tenement
houses, no Unions, no Work-houses. Our lower classes
do not yet ape the upper class people, either in their
habits or dress. The wife of a peasant or of a mechanic
wears a simple snowy cap, and a serge or cotton dress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
The wife of a shopkeeper does not wear any jewelry
because she cannot afford to buy real stones, and her
taste is too good to allow of her wearing false ones.
She is not ashamed of her husband&rsquo;s occupation; she
does not play the fine lady while he is at work. She
saves him the expense of a cashier or of an extra clerk
by helping him in his business. When the shutters
are up, she enjoys life with him, and is the companion
of his pleasures as well as of his hardships. Club life
is unknown in France, except among the upper classes.
Man and wife are constantly together, and France is a
nation of Darbys and Joans. There is, I believe, no
country where men and women go through life on such
equal terms as in France.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In England (and here again I speak of the masses
only), the man thinks himself a much superior being to
the woman. It is the same in Germany. In America,
I should feel inclined to believe that a woman looks
down upon a man with a certain amount of contempt.
She receives at his hands attentions of all sorts, but I
cannot say, as I have remarked before, that I have ever
discovered in her the slightest trace of gratitude to
man.</p>

<p>I have often tried to explain to myself this gentle
contempt of American ladies for the male sex; for, contrasting
it with the lovely devotion of Jonathan to his
womankind, it is a curious enigma. Have I found the
solution at last? Does it begin at school? In American
schools, boys and girls, from the age of five, follow
the same path to learning, and sit side by side on the
same benches. Moreover, the girls prove themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
capable of keeping pace with the boys. Is it not possible
that those girls, as they watched the performances
of the boys in the study, learned to say, &ldquo;Is
that all?&rdquo; While the young lords of creation, as they
have looked on at what &ldquo;those girls&rdquo; can do, have
been fain to exclaim: &ldquo;Who would have thought it!&rdquo;
And does not this explain the two attitudes: the great
respect of men for women, and the mild contempt of
women for men?</p>

<p>Very often, in New York, when I had time to saunter
about, I would go up Broadway and wait until a car,
well crammed with people, came along. Then I would
jump on board and stand near the door. Whenever a
man wanted to get out, he would say to me &ldquo;Please,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; or just touch me lightly to warn me
that I stood in his way. But the women! Oh, the
women! why, it was simply lovely. They would just
push me away with the tips of their fingers, and turn
up such disgusted and haughty noses! You would
have imagined it was a heap of dirty rubbish in their
way.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Would you have a fair illustration of the respective
positions of woman in France, in England, and in
America?</p>

<p>Go to a hotel, and watch the arrival of couples in
the dining-room.</p>

<p>Now don&rsquo;t go to the Louvre, the Grand Hotel, or
the Bristol, in Paris. Don&rsquo;t go to the Savoy, the
Victoria, or the Metropole, in London. Don&rsquo;t go to
the Brunswick, in New York, because in all these hotels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
you will see that all behave alike. Go elsewhere and,
I say, watch.</p>

<p>In France, you will see the couples arrive together,
walk abreast toward the table assigned to them, very
often arm in arm, and smiling at each other&mdash;though
married.</p>

<p>In England, you will see John Bull leading the way.
He does not like to be seen eating in public, and
thinks it very hard that he should not have the dining-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
all to himself. So he enters, with his hands in
his pockets, looking askance at everybody right and
left. Then, meek and demure, with her eyes cast down,
follows Mrs. John Bull.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:408px; height:430px" src="images/img120.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">IN ENGLAND.</p></div>

<p>In America, behold the dignified, nay, the majestic
entry of Mrs. Jonathan, a perfect queen going toward
her throne, bestowing a glance on her subjects right
and left&mdash;and Jonathan behind!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span> </p>

<p>They say in France that Paris is the paradise of
women. If so, there is a more blissful place than
paradise; there is another word to invent to give an
idea of the social position enjoyed by American ladies.</p>

<p>If I had to be born again, and might choose my sex
and my birthplace, I would shout at the top of my
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, make me an American woman!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="tt">More about Journalism in America&mdash;A Dinner
at Delmonico&rsquo;s&mdash;My First Appearance in an
American Church.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>Sunday Night, January</i> 19.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Have</span> been spending the whole day in reading
the Sunday papers.</p>

<p>I am never tired of reading and studying the American
newspapers. The whole character of the nation
is there: Spirit of enterprise, liveliness, childishness,
inquisitiveness, deep interest in everything that is
human, fun and humor, indiscretion, love of gossip,
brightness.</p>

<p>Speak of electric light, of phonographs and graphophones,
if you like; speak of those thousand and one
inventions which have come out of the American
brain; but if you wish to mention the greatest and
most wonderful achievement of American activity,
do not hesitate for a moment to give the palm to
American journalism; it is simply the <i>ne plus ultra</i>.</p>

<p>You will find some people, even in America, who
condemn its loud tone; others who object to its meddling
with private life; others, again, who have something
to say of its contempt for statements which are
not in perfect accordance with strict truth. I even
believe that a French writer, whom I do not wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
name, once said that very few statements to be found
in an American paper were to be relied upon&mdash;beyond
the date. People may say this and may say that
about American journalism; I confess that I like it,
simply because it will supply you with twelve&mdash;on
Sundays with thirty&mdash;pages that are readable from
the first line to the last. Yes, from the first line to
the last, including the advertisements.</p>

<p>The American journalist may be a man of letters,
but, above all, he must possess a bright and graphic
pen, and his services are not wanted if he cannot write
a racy article or paragraph out of the most trifling incident.
He must relate facts, if he can, but if he cannot,
so much the worse for the facts; he must be
entertaining and turn out something that is readable.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, a reporter has to send to his
paper the account of a police-court proceeding. There
is nothing more important to bring to the office than
the case of a servant girl who has robbed her mistress
of a pair of diamond earrings. The English reporter
will bring to his editor something in the following
style:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Mary Jane So-and-So was yesterday charged before the magistrate
with stealing a pair of diamond earrings from her mistress.
It appears [always <i>it appears</i>, that is the formula] that, last Monday,
as Mrs. X. went to her room to dress for dinner, she missed a
pair of diamond earrings, which she usually kept in a little drawer
in her bedroom. On questioning her maid on the subject, she received
incoherent answers. Suspicion that the maid was the thief
arose in her mind, and&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>A long paragraph in this dry style will be published
in the <i>Times</i>, or any other London morning paper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span> </p>

<p>Now, the American reporter will be required to
bring something a little more entertaining if he hopes
to be worth his salt on the staff of his paper, and he
will probably get up an account of the case somewhat
in the following fashion:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Mary Jane So-and-so is a pretty little brunette of some twenty
summers. On looking in the glass at her dainty little ears, she
fancied how lovely a pair of diamond earrings would look in them.
So one day she thought she would try on those of her mistress.
How lovely she looked! said the looking-glass, and the Mephistopheles
that is hidden in the corner of every man or woman&rsquo;s
breast suggested that she should keep them. This is how Mary
Jane found herself in trouble, etc., etc.</p></div>

<p>The whole will read like a little story, probably entitled
something like &ldquo;Another Gretchen gone wrong
through the love of jewels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heading has to be thought of no less than the
paragraph. Not a line is to be dull in a paper sparkling
all over with eye-ticklers of all sorts. Oh! those
delicious headings that would resuscitate the dead, and
make them sit up in their graves!</p>

<p>A Tennessee paper which I have now under my eyes
announces the death of a townsman with the following
heading:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock last night Joseph W. Nelson put on
his angel plumage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>&ldquo;Racy, catching advertisements supplied to the
trade,&rdquo; such is the announcement that I see in the
same paper. I understand the origin of such literary
productions as the following, which I cull from a Colorado
sheet:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span> </p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This morning our Saviour summoned away the jeweler William
T. Sumner, of our city, from his shop to another and a better
world. The undersigned, his widow, will weep upon his tomb, as
will also his two daughters, Maud and Emma, the former of whom
is married, and the other is open to an offer. The funeral will
take place to-morrow. Signed. His disconsolate widow, Mathilda
Sumner.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;This bereavement will not interrupt our business, which
will be carried on as usual, only our place of business will be removed
from Washington Street to No. 17 St. Paul Street, as our
grasping landlord has raised our rent.&mdash;M. S.</p></div>

<p>The following advertisement probably emanates
from the same firm:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Personal&mdash;His Love Suddenly Returned</span>.&mdash;Recently
they had not been on the best of terms, owing to a little family jar
occasioned by the wife insisting on being allowed to renovate his
wearing apparel, and which, of course, was done in a bungling
manner; in order to prevent the trouble, they agreed to send all
their work hereafter to D., the tailor, and now everything is lovely,
and peace and happiness again reign in their household.</p></div>

<p>All this is lively. Never fail to read the advertisements
of an American paper, or you will not have got
out of it all the fun it supplies.</p>

<p>Here are a few from the Cincinnati <i>Enquirer</i>, which
tell different stories:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>1. The young <span class="sc">Madame J. C. Antonia</span>, just arrived from
Europe, will remain a short time; tells past, present, and future;
tells by the letters in hand who the future husband or wife will be;
brings back the husband or lover in so many days, and guarantees
to settle family troubles; can give good luck and success; ladies
call at once; also cures corns and bunions. Hours 10 <span class="scs">A. M.</span> and
9 <span class="scs">P. M.</span></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Also cures corns and bunions&rdquo; is a poem!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span> </p>

<div class="quote">
<p>2. The acquaintance desired of lady passing along Twelfth
Street at three o&rsquo;clock Sunday afternoon, by blond gent standing
at corner. Address <span class="sc">Lou</span> K., 48, <i>Enquirer</i> Office.</p>

<p>3. Will the three ladies that got on the electric car at the Zoo
Sunday afternoon favor three gents that got off at Court and Walnut
Streets with their address? Address <span class="sc">Electric Car</span>, <i>Enquirer</i>
Office.</p>

<p>4. Will two ladies on Clark Street car, that noticed two gents
in front of Grand Opera House about seven last evening, please
address <span class="sc">Jands</span>, <i>Enquirer</i> Office.</p></div>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>A short time ago a man named Smith was bitten by
a rattlesnake and treated with whisky at a New York
hospital. An English paper would have just mentioned
the fact, and have the paragraph headed: &ldquo;A
Remarkable Cure&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;A Man Cured of a Rattlesnake
Bite by Whisky&rdquo;; but a kind correspondent
sends me the headings of this bit of intelligence in five
New York papers. They are as follows:</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;Smith Is All Right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. &ldquo;Whisky Does It!&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;The Snake Routed at all Points!&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;The Reptile is Nowhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;Drunk for Three Days and Cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let a batch of officials be dismissed. Do not suppose
that an American editor will accept the news
with such a heading as &ldquo;Dismissal of Officials.&rdquo; The
reporter will have to bring some label that will fetch
the attention. &ldquo;Massacre at the Custom House,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;So Many Heads in the Basket,&rdquo; will do. Now, I
maintain that it requires a wonderful imagination&mdash;something
little short of genius, to be able, day after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
day, to hit on a hundred of such headings. But the
American journalist does it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:463px; height:430px" src="images/img128.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SMITH CURED OF RATTLESNAKE BITE.</p></div>

<p>An American paper is a collection of short stories.
The Sunday edition of the New York <i>World</i>, the
New York <i>Herald</i>, the Boston <i>Herald</i>, the Boston
<i>Globe</i>, the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>, the Chicago <i>Herald</i>, and
many others, is something like ten volumes of miscellaneous
literature, and I do not know of any achievement
to be compared to it.</p>

<p>I cannot do better than compare an American
paper to a large store, where the goods, the articles,
are labeled so as to immediately strike the customer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span> </p>

<p>A few days ago, I heard my friend, Colonel Charles
H. Taylor, editor of the Boston <i>Globe</i>, give an interesting
summary of an address on journalism which he
is to deliver next Saturday before the members of the
New England Club of Boston. He maintained that the
proprietor of a newspaper has as much right to make
his shop-window attractive to the public as any tradesman.
If the colonel is of opinion that journalism
is a trade, and the journalist a mere tradesman, I agree
with him. If journalism is not to rank among the
highest and noblest of professions, and is to be nothing
more than a commercial enterprise, I agree with
him.</p>

<p>Now, if we study the evolution of journalism for the
last forty or fifty years, we shall see that daily journalism,
especially in a democracy, has become a commercial
enterprise, and that journalism, as it was understood
forty years ago, has become to-day monthly journalism.
The dailies have now no other object than to give the
news&mdash;the latest&mdash;just as a tradesman that would succeed
must give you the latest fashion in any kind of
business. The people of a democracy like America are
educated in politics. They think for themselves, and
care but little for the opinions of such and such a journalist
on any question of public interest. They want
news, not literary essays on news. When I hear some
Americans say that they object to their daily journalism,
I answer that journalists are like other people who
supply the public&mdash;they keep the article that is
wanted.</p>

<p>A free country possesses the government it deserves,
and the journalism it wants. A people active and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
busy as the Americans are, want a journalism that will
keep their interest awake and amuse them; and they
naturally get it. The average American, for example,
cares not a pin for what his representatives say or
do in Washington; but he likes to be acquainted with
what is going on in Europe, and that is why the
American journalist will give him a far more detailed
account of what is going on in the Palace at Westminster
than of what is being said in the Capitol.</p>

<p>In France, journalism is personal. On any great
question of the day, domestic or foreign, the Frenchman
will want to read the opinion of John Lemoinne
in the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, or the opinion of Edouard
Lockroy in the <i>Rappel</i>, or maybe that of Paul de
Cassagnac or Henri Rochefort. Every Frenchman is
more or less led by the editor of the newspaper which
he patronizes. But the Frenchman is only a democrat
in name and aspirations, not in fact. France made
the mistake of establishing a republic before she made
republicans of her sons. A French journalist signs
his articles, and is a leader of public opinion, so much
so that every successful journalist in France has been,
is now, and ever will be, elected a representative of
the people.</p>

<p>In America, as in England, the journalist has no
personality outside the literary classes. Who, among
the masses, knows the names of Bennett, Dana, Whitelaw
Reid, Medill, Childs, in the United States? Who,
in England, knows the names of Lawson, Mudford,
Robinson, and other editors of the great dailies? If
it had not been for his trial and imprisonment, Mr. W.
T. Stead himself, though a most brilliant journalist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
would never have seen his name on anybody&rsquo;s
lips.</p>

<p>A leading article in an American or an English
newspaper will attract no notice at home. It will
only be quoted on the European Continent.</p>

<p>It is the monthly and the weekly papers and magazines
that now play the part of the dailies of bygone
days. An article in the <i>Spectator</i> or <i>Saturday Review</i>,
or especially in one of the great monthly magazines,
will be quoted all over the land, and I believe that
this relatively new journalism, which is read only by
the cultured, has now for ever taken the place of the
old one.</p>

<p>In a country where everybody reads, men as well
as women; in a country where nobody takes much
interest in politics outside of the State and the city in
which he lives, the journalist has to turn out every
day all the news he can gather, and present them to
the reader in the most readable form. Formerly daily
journalism was a branch of literature; now it is a
news store, and is so not only in America. The English
press shows signs of the same tendency, and so
does the Parisian press. Take the London <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i> and <i>Star</i>, and the Paris <i>Figaro</i>, as illustrations
of what I advance.</p>

<p>As democracy makes progress in England, journalism
will become more and more American, although the
English reporter will have some trouble in succeeding
to compete with his American <i>confrère</i> in humor and
liveliness.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of political leaders, the newspapers
of Continental Europe direct public opinion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
In a democracy, the newspapers follow public opinion
and cater to the public taste; they are the servants of
the people. The American says to his journalists: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care a pin for your opinions on such a question.
Give me the news and I will comment on it myself.
Only don&rsquo;t forget that I am an overworked man, and
that before, or after, my fourteen hours&rsquo; work, I want
to be entertained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, as I have said elsewhere, the American journalist
must be spicy, lively, and bright. He must know
how, not merely to report, but to relate in a racy,
catching style, an accident, a trial, a conflagration, and
be able to make up an article of one or two columns
upon the most insignificant incident. He must be
interesting, readable. His eyes and ears must be
always open, every one of his five senses on the alert,
for he must keep ahead in this wild race for news.
He must be a good conversationalist on most subjects,
so as to bring back from his interviews with different
people a good store of materials. He must be a man
of courage, to brave rebuffs. He must be a philosopher,
to pocket abuse cheerfully.</p>

<p>He must be a man of honor, to inspire confidence
in the people he has to deal with. Personally I can
say this of him, that wherever I have begged him, for
instance, to kindly abstain from mentioning this or
that which might have been said in conversation
with him, I have invariably found that he kept his
word.</p>

<p>But if the matter is of public interest, he is, before
and above all, the servant of the public; so, never
challenge his spirit of enterprise, or he will leave no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
stone unturned until he has found out your secret and
exhibited it in public.</p>

<p>I do not think that American journalism needs an
apology.</p>

<p>It is the natural outcome of circumstances and the
democratic times we live in. The Théâtre-Français is
not now, under a Republic, and probably never again
will be, what it was when it was placed under the patronage
and supervision of the French Court. Democracy
is the form of government least of all calculated to
foster literature and the fine arts. To that purpose,
Monarchy, with its Court and its fashionable society,
is the best. This is no reason to prefer a monarchy to
a republic. Liberty, like any other luxury, has to be
paid for.</p>

<p>Journalism cannot be now what it was when papers
were read by people of culture. In a democracy, the
stage and journalism have to please the masses of the
people. As the people become better and better educated,
the stage and journalism will rise with them.
What the people want, I repeat it, is news, and journals
are properly called <i>news</i> papers.</p>

<p>Speaking of American journalism, no man need use
apologetic language.</p>

<p>Not when the proprietor of an American paper will
not hesitate to spend thousands of dollars to provide
his readers with the minutest details about some great
European event.</p>

<p>Not when an American paper will, at its own expense,
send Henry M. Stanley to Africa in search of Livingstone.</p>

<p>Not so long as the American press is vigilant, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
keeps its thousand eyes open on the interests of the
American people.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Midnight.</i></p>

<p>Dined this evening with Richard Mansfield at Delmonico&rsquo;s.
I sat between Mr. Charles A. Dana, the
first of American journalists, and General Horace Porter,
and had what my American friends would call &ldquo;a
mighty elegant time.&rdquo; The host was delightful, the
dinner excellent, the wine &ldquo;extra dry,&rdquo; the speeches
quite the reverse. &ldquo;Speeches&rdquo; is rather a big word
for what took place at dessert. Every one supplied an
anecdote, a story, a reminiscence, and contributed to
the general entertainment of the guests.</p>

<p>The Americans have too much humor to spoil their
dinners with toasts to the President, the Senate, the
House of Representatives, the army, the navy, the
militia, the volunteers, and the reserved forces.</p>

<p>I once heard Mr. Chauncey M. Depew referring to
the volunteers, at some English public dinner, as &ldquo;men
invincible&mdash;in peace, and invisible&mdash;in war.&rdquo; After
dinner I remarked to an English peer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard to-night the great New York after-dinner
speaker; what do you think of his speech?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was witty; but I think his
remark about our volunteers was not in very good
taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remained composed, and did not burst.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Newburgh, N. Y.</i>, <i>January</i> 21.</p>

<p>I lectured in Melrose, near Boston, last night, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
had the satisfaction of pleasing a Massachusetts audience
for the second time. After the lecture, I had
supper with Mr. Nat Goodwin, a very good actor, who
is now playing in Boston in a new play by Mr. Steele
Mackaye. Mr. Nat Goodwin told many good stories
at supper. He can entertain his friends in private as
well as he can the public.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>To-night I have appeared in a church, in Newburgh.
The minister, who took the chair, had the good sense
to refrain from opening the lecture with prayer. There
are many who have not the tact necessary to see that
praying before a humorous lecture is almost as irreverent
as praying before a glass of grog. It is as an artist,
however, that I resent that prayer. After the audience
have said <i>Amen</i>, it takes them a full quarter of an hour
to realize that the lecture is not a sermon; that they
are in a church, but not at church; and the whole
time their minds are in that undecided state, all
your points fall flat and miss fire. Even without the
preliminary prayer, I dislike lecturing in a church.
The very atmosphere of a church is against the success
of a light, humorous lecture, and many a point,
which would bring down the house in a theater, will be
received only with smiles in a lecture hall, and in respectful
silence in a church. An audience is greatly
influenced by surroundings.</p>

<p>Now, I must say that the interior of an American
church, with its lines of benches, its galleries, and its
platform, does not inspire in one such religious feelings
as the interior of a European Catholic church. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
many American towns, the church is let for meetings,
concerts, exhibitions, bazaars, etc., and so far as you
can see, there is nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary
lecture hall.</p>

<p>Yet it is a church, and both lecturer and audience
feel it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="tt">Marcus Aurelius in America&mdash;Chairmen I have
had&mdash;American, English, and Scotch Chairmen&mdash;One
who had Been to Boulogne&mdash;Talkative
and Silent Chairmen&mdash;A Trying Occasion&mdash;The
Lord is Asked to Allow the
Audience to See my Points.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>January</i> 22.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">There</span> are indeed very few Americans who have
not either tact or a sense of humor. They make
the best of chairmen. They know that the audience
have not come to hear them, and that all that is required
of them is to introduce the lecturer in very few
words, and to give him a good start. Who is the
lecturer that would not appreciate, nay, love, such a
chairman as Dr. R. S. MacArthur, who introduced me
yesterday to a New York audience in the following
manner?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the story goes
that, last summer, a party of Americans staying in
Rome paid a visit to the famous Spithöver&rsquo;s bookshop
in the Piazza di Spagna. Now Spithöver is the most
learned of bibliophiles. You must go thither if you need
artistic and archæological works of the profoundest
research and erudition. But one of the ladies in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
tourists&rsquo; party only wanted the lively travels in America
of Max O&rsquo;Rell, and she asked for the book at Spithöver&rsquo;s.
There came in a deep guttural voice&mdash;an
Anglo-German voice&mdash;from a spectacled clerk behind
a desk, to this purport: &lsquo;Marcus Aurelius vos neffer in
te Unided Shtaates!&rsquo; But, ladies and gentlemen, he
is now, and here he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With such an introduction, I was immediately in
touch with my audience.</p>

<p>What a change after English chairmen!</p>

<p>A few days before lecturing in any English town,
under the auspices of a Literary Society or Mechanics&rsquo;
Institute, the lecturer generally receives from the
secretary a letter running somewhat as follow:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have much pleasure in informing you that our Mr. Blank, one
of our vice-presidents and a well-known resident here, will take the
chair at your lecture.</p></div>

<p>Translated into plain English, this reads:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>My poor fellow, I am much grieved to have to inform you that a
chairman will be inflicted upon you on the occasion of your lecture
before the members of our Society.</p></div>

<p>In my few years&rsquo; lecturing experience, I have come
across all sorts and conditions of chairmen, but I can
recollect very few that &ldquo;have helped me.&rdquo; Now, what
is the office, the duty, of a chairman on such occasions?
He is supposed to introduce the lecturer to the
audience. For this he needs to be able to make a neat
speech. He has to tell the audience who the lecturer
is, in case they should not know it, which is seldom the
case.  I was once introduced to an audience who
knew me, by a chairman who, I don&rsquo;t think, had ever
heard of me in his life. Before going on the platform
he asked me whether I had written anything, next
whether I was an Irishman or a Frenchman, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:438px; height:610px" src="images/img139.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;MARCUS AURELIUS VOS NEFFER IN TE UNIDED SHTAATES!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span> </p>

<p>Sometimes the chairman is nervous; he hems and
haws, cannot find the words he wants, and only succeeds
in fidgeting the audience. Sometimes, on the
other hand, he is a wit. There is danger again. I was
once introduced to a New York audience by General
Horace Porter. Those of my readers who know the
delightful general and have heard him deliver one of
those little gems of speeches in his own inimitable
manner, will agree with me that certainly there was
danger in that; and they will not be surprised when I
tell them that after his delightfully witty and graceful
little introduction, I felt as if the best part of the show
was over.</p>

<p>Sometimes the chair has to be offered to a magnate
of the neighborhood, though he may be noted for his
long, prosy orations&mdash;which annoy the public; or to a
very popular man in the locality who gets all the applause&mdash;which
annoys the lecturer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brevity is the soul of wit,&rdquo; should be the motto of
chairmen, and I sympathize with a friend of mine who
says that chairmen, like little boys and girls, should be
seen and not heard.</p>

<p>Of those chairmen who can and do speak, the Scotch
ones are generally good. They have a knack of starting
the evening with some droll Scotch anecdote, told
with that piquant and picturesque accent of theirs, and
of putting the audience in a good humor. Occasionally
they will also make <i>apropos</i> and equally droll little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
speeches at the close. One evening, in talking of
America, I had mentioned the fact that American banquets
were very lively, and that I thought the fact of
Americans being able to keep up such a flow of wit for
so many hours, was perhaps due to their drinking Apollinaris
water instead of stronger things after dessert.
At the end of the lecture, the chairman rose and said
he had greatly enjoyed it, but that he must take exception
to one statement the lecturer had made, for
he thought it &ldquo;fery deeficult to be wutty on Apollinaris
watter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another kind of chairman is the one who kills your
finish, and stops all the possibility of your being called
back for applause, by coming forward, the very instant
the last words are out of your mouth, to inform the
audience that the next lecture will be given by Mr. So-and-So,
or to make a statement of the Society&rsquo;s financial
position, concluding by appealing to the members
to induce their friends to join.</p>

<p>Then there is the chairman who does not know what
you are going to talk about, but thinks it his duty to
give the audience a kind of summary of what he imagines
the lecture is going to be. He is terrible. But he
is nothing to the one who, when the lecture is over,
will persist in summing it up, and explaining your
own jokes, especially the ones he has not quite seen
through. This is the dullest, the saddest chairman yet
invented.</p>

<p>Some modest chairmen apologize for standing between
the lecturer and the audience, and declare they
cannot speak, but do. Others promise to speak a minute
only, but don&rsquo;t.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:437px; height:610px" src="images/img142.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CHAIRMAN.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I speak about?&rdquo; said a chairman to me
one day, after I had been introduced to him in the little
back room behind the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will oblige me, sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;kindly speak
about&mdash;one minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I was introduced to the audience as the promoter
of good feelings between France and England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;we see clouds of
misunderstanding arise between the French&mdash;between
the English&mdash;between the two. The lecturer of this
evening makes it his business to disperse these clouds&mdash;these
clouds&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash; But I will not detain you
any longer. His name is familiar to all of us. I&rsquo;m
sure he needs no introduction to this audience. We
all know him. I have much pleasure in introducing
to you Mr.&mdash;Mosshiay&mdash;Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then he looked at
me in despair.</p>

<p>It was evident he had forgotten my name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Max O&rsquo;Rell is, I believe, what you are driving at,&rdquo;
I whispered to him.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The most objectionable chairmen in England are,
perhaps, local men holding civic honors. Accustomed
to deliver themselves of a speech whenever and wherever
they get a chance, aldermen, town councilors,
members of local boards, and school boards, never
miss an opportunity of getting upon a platform to
address a good crowd. Not long ago, I was introduced
to an audience in a large English city by a candidate
for civic honors. The election of the town council
was to take place a fortnight afterward, and this gentleman
profited by the occasion to air all his grievances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
against the sitting council, and to assure the citizens
that if they would only elect him, there were bright
days in store for them and their city. This was the
gist of the matter. The speech lasted twenty minutes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:458px; height:430px" src="images/img144.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Once the chair was taken by an alderman in a Lancashire
city, and the hall was crowded. &ldquo;What a fine
house!&rdquo; I remarked to the chairman as we sat down
on the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fine indeed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;everybody in the
town knew I was going to take the chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was sorry I had spoken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span> </p>

<p>More than once, when announced to deliver a lecture
on France and the French, I have been introduced
by a chairman who, having spent his holidays in that
country once or twice, opened the evening&rsquo;s proceedings
by himself delivering a lecture on France. I have
felt very tempted to imitate a <i>confrère</i>, and say to the
audience: &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, as one lecture on
France is enough for an evening, perhaps you would
rather I spoke about something else now.&rdquo; The <i>confrère</i>
I have just mentioned was to deliver a lecture on
Charles Dickens one evening. The chairman knew
something of Charles Dickens and, for quite a quarter
of an hour, spoke on the great English novelist, giving
anecdotes, extracts of his writings, etc. When the
lecturer rose, he said: &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, two
lectures on Charles Dickens are perhaps more than you
expected to hear to-night. You have just heard a
lecture on Charles Dickens. I am now going to give
you one on Charles Kingsley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes I get a little amusement, however (as in
the country town of X.), out of the usual proceedings
of the society before whose members I am engaged to
appear. At X., the audience being assembled and the
time up, I was told to go on the platform alone and,
being there, to immediately sit down. So I went on,
and sat down. Some one in the room then rose and
proposed that Mr. N. should take the chair. Mr. N.,
it appeared, had been to Boulogne (<i>to B&rsquo;long</i>), and was
particularly fitted to introduce a Frenchman. In a
speech of about five minutes duration, all Mr. N.&rsquo;s
qualifications for the post of chairman that evening
were duly set forth. Then some one else rose and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
seconded the proposition, re-enumerating most of these
qualifications. Mr. N. then marched up the hall,
ascended the platform, and proceeded to return thanks
for the kind manner in which he had been proposed
for the chair and for the enthusiasm (a few friends had
applauded) with which the audience had sanctioned
the choice. He said it was true that he had been in
France, and that he greatly admired the country and
the people, and he was glad to have this opportunity
to say so before a Frenchman. Then he related some
of his traveling impressions in France. A few people
coughed, two or three more bold stamped their feet,
but he took no heed and, for ten minutes, he gave the
audience the benefit of the information he had gathered
in Boulogne. These preliminaries over, I gave
my lecture, after which Mr. N. called upon a member
of the audience to propose a vote of thanks to the
lecturer &ldquo;for the most amusing and interesting discourse,
etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now a paid lecturer wants his check when his work
is over, and although a vote of thanks, when it is
spontaneous, is a compliment which he greatly appreciates,
he is more likely to feel awkwardness than
pleasure when it is a mere red-tape formality. The
vote of thanks, on this particular occasion, was proposed
in due form. Then it was seconded by some
one who repeated two or three of my points and spoiled
them. By this time I began to enter into the fun of
the thing, and, after having returned thanks for the
vote of thanks and sat down, I stepped forward again,
filled with a mild resolve to have the last word:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have now much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
pleasure in proposing that a hearty vote of thanks be
given Mr. N. for the able manner in which he has
filled the chair. I am proud to have been introduced
to you by an Englishman who knows my country so
well.&rdquo; I went again through the list of Mr. N.&rsquo;s
qualifications, not forgetting the trip to Boulogne and
the impressions it had left on him. Somebody rose
and seconded this. Mr. N. delivered a speech to
thank the audience once more, and then those who
had survived went home.</p>

<p>Some Nonconformist societies will engage a light or
humorous lecturer, put him in their chapel, and open
his mouth with prayer. Prayer is good, but I would
as soon think of saying grace before dancing as of beginning
my lecture with a prayer. This kind of experience
has been mine several times. A truly trying
experience it was, on the first occasion, to be accompanied
to the platform by the minister, who, motioning
me to sit down, advanced to the front, lowered his
head, and said in solemn accents: &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo;
After I got started, it took me fully ten minutes to
make the people realize that they were not at church.
This experience I have had in America as well as in
England. Another experience in this line was still
worse, for the prayer was supplemented by the singing
of a hymn of ten or twelve verses. You may easily
imagine that my first remark fell dead flat.</p>

<p>I have been introduced to audiences as Mossoo,
Meshoe, and Mounzeer O&rsquo;Reel, and other British adaptations
of our word <i>Monsieur</i>, and found it very difficult
to bear with equanimity a chairman who maltreated
a name which I had taken some care to keep correctly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
spelt before the public. Yet this man is charming
when compared with the one who, in the midst of his
introductory remarks, turns to you, and in a stage
whisper perfectly audible all over the hall, asks: &ldquo;How
do you pronounce your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Passing over chairman chatty and chairman terse,
chairman eloquent and chairman the reverse, I feel decidedly
most kindly toward the silent chairman. He
is very rare, but he does exist and, when met with, is exceedingly
precious. Why he exists, in some English
Institutes, I have always been at a loss to imagine.
Whether he comes on to see that the lecturer does not
run off before his time is up, or with the water bottle,
which is the only portable thing on the platform generally;
whether he is a successor to some venerable
deaf and dumb founder of his Society; or whether he
goes on with the lecturer to give a lesson in modesty
to the public, as who should say: &ldquo;I could speak an if
I would, but I forbear.&rdquo; Be his <i>raison d&rsquo;être</i> what it
may, we all love him. To the nervous novice he is a
kind of quiet support, to the old stager he is as a picture
unto the eye and as music unto the ear.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Here I pause. I want to collect my thoughts. Does
my memory serve me? Am I dreaming, or worse still,
am I on the point of inventing? No, I could not invent
such a story, it is beyond my power.</p>

<p>I was once lecturing to the students of a religious
college in America. Before I began, a professor
stepped forward, and offered a prayer, in which he
asked the Lord to allow the audience to see my points.</p>

<p>Now, I duly feel the weight of responsibility attaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
to such a statement, and in justice to myself I
can do no less than give the reader the petition just
as it fell on my astonished ears:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, Thou knowest that we work hard for Thee,
and that recreation is necessary in order that we may
work with renewed vigor. We have to-night with us
a gentleman from France [excuse my recording a compliment
too flattering], whose criticisms are witty and
refined, <i>but subtle</i>, and we pray Thee to so prepare our
minds that we may thoroughly understand and enjoy
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>But subtle!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am still wondering whether my lectures are so
subtle as to need praying over, or whether that audience
was so dull that they needed praying for.</p>

<p>Whichever it was, the prayer was heard, for the audience
proved warm, keen, and thoroughly appreciative.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="tt1">Reflections on the Typical American.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>January</i> 23.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">I was</span> asked to-day by the editor of the <i>North
American Review</i> to write an article on the typical
American.</p>

<p>The typical American!</p>

<p>In the eyes of my beloved compatriots, the typical
American is a man with hair falling over his shoulders,
wearing a sombrero, a red shirt, leather leggings, a
pair of revolvers in his belt, spending his life on horseback,
and able to shoot a fly off the tip of your nose
without for a moment endangering your olfactory
organ; and, since Buffalo Bill has been exhibiting his
Indians and cowboys to the Parisians, this impression
has become a deep conviction.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the astonishment I caused to my
mother when I first broke the news to her that I
wanted to go to America. My mother had practically
never left a lovely little provincial town of
France. Her face expressed perfect bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you want to go to America?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am invited to give lectures there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lectures? in what language?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother, I will try my best in English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they speak English out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;pretty well, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did not go any further on the subject that time.
Probably the good mother thought of the time when
the Californian gold-fields attracted all the scum of
Europe, and, no doubt, she thought that it was strange
for a man who had a decent position in Europe, to go
and &ldquo;seek fortune&rdquo; in America.</p>

<p>Later on, however, after returning to England, I
wrote to her that I had made up my mind to go.</p>

<p>Her answer was full of gentle reproaches, and of
sorrow at seeing that she had lost all her influence
over her son. She signed herself &ldquo;always your loving
mother,&rdquo; and indulged in a postscript. Madame de
Sévigné said that the gist of a woman&rsquo;s letter was to
be found in the postscript.</p>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s was this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I shall not tell any one in the town that you
have gone to America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explains why I still dare show my face in my
little native town.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The typical American!</p>

<p>First of all, does he exist? I do not think so. As
I have said elsewhere, there are Americans in plenty,
but <i>the</i> American has not made his appearance yet.
The type existed a hundred years ago in New England.
He is there still; but he is not now a national type,
he is only a local one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:375px; height:610px" src="images/img152.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE TYPICAL AMERICAN.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span> </p>

<p>I was talking one day with two eminent Americans
on the subject of the typical American, real or imaginary.
One of them was of opinion that he was a taciturn
being; the other, on the contrary, maintained
that he was talkative. How is a foreigner to dare
decide, where two eminent natives find it impossible to
agree?</p>

<p>In speaking of the typical American, let us understand
each other. All the civilized nations of the
earth are alike in one respect; they are all composed
of two kinds of men, those that are gentlemen, and
those that are not. America is no exception to this
rule. Fifth Avenue does not differ from Belgravia
and Mayfair. A gentleman is everywhere a gentleman.
As a type, he belongs to no particular country,
he is universal.</p>

<p>When the writer of some &ldquo;society&rdquo; paper, English
or American, reproaches a sociologist for writing about
the masses instead of the classes, suggesting that &ldquo;he
probably never frequented the best society of the
nation he describes,&rdquo; that writer writes himself down
an ass.</p>

<p>In the matters of feeling, conduct, taste, culture, I
have never discovered the least difference between a
gentleman from America and a gentleman from
France, England, Russia, or any other country of
Europe&mdash;including Germany. So, if we want to find a
typical American, it is not in good society that we
must search for him, but among the mass of the population.</p>

<p>Well, it is just here that our search will break down.
We shall come across all sorts and conditions of Americans,
but not one that is really typical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:485px; height:610px" src="images/img154.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE AMERICAN OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span></p>

<p>A little while ago, the <i>Century Magazine</i> published
specimens of composite photography. First, there was
the portrait of one person, then that of this same face
with another superposed, then another containing
three faces blended, and so on up to eight or nine. On
the last page the result was shown. I can only compare
the typical American to the last of those. This
appears to me the process of evolution through which
the American type is now going. What it will be
when this process of evolution is over, no one, I imagine,
can tell. The evolution will be complete when
immigration shall have ceased, and all the different
types have been well mixed and assimilated. While
the process of assimilation is still going on, the result
is suspended, and the type is incomplete.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, are there not certain characteristic
traits to be found throughout almost all America?
That is a question much easier to answer.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to repeat that I put aside good society
and confine myself merely to the people?</p>

<p>Nations are like individuals: when they are young,
they have the qualities and the defects of children.
The characteristic trait of childhood is curiosity. It is
also that of the American. I have never been in Australia,
but I should expect to find this trait in the
Australian.</p>

<p>Look at American journalism. What does it live
on? Scandal and gossip. Let a writer, an artist, or
any one else become popular in the States, and the
papers will immediately tell the public at what time
he rises and what he takes for breakfast. When any
one of the least importance arrives in America, he is
quickly beset by a band of reporters who ask him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
host of preposterous questions and examine him minutely
from head to foot, in order to tell the public
next day whether he wears laced, buttoned, or elastic
boots, enlighten them as to the cut of his coat and the
color of his trowsers, and let them know if he parts his
hair in the middle or not.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:420px; height:430px" src="images/img156.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CURIOSITY IN AUSTRALIA.</p></div>

<p>Every time I went into a new town to lecture I was
interviewed, and the next day, besides an account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
the lecture, there was invariably a paragraph somewhat
in this style:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The lecturer is a man of about forty, whose cranium is getting
visible through his hair. He wears a double eye-glass, with which
he plays while talking to his audience. His handkerchief was
black-bordered. He wore the regulation patent leather shoes, and
his shirt front was fastened with a single stud. He spoke without
effort or pretension, and often with his hands in his pockets, etc.</p></div>

<p>A few days ago, on reading the morning papers in a
town where I had lectured the night before, I found,
in one of them, about twenty lines consecrated to my
lecture, and half a column to my hat.</p>

<p>I must tell you that this hat was brown, and all the
hats in America are black. If you wear anything
that is not exactly like what Americans wear, you are
gazed at as if you were a curious animal. The Americans
are as great <i>badauds</i> as the Parisians. In London,
you may go down Regent Street or Piccadilly
got up as a Swiss admiral, a Polish general, or even a
Highlander, and nobody will take the trouble to look at
you. But, in America, you have only to put on a brown
hat or a pair of light trowsers, and you will become the
object of a curiosity which will not fail very promptly
to bore you, if you are fond of tranquility, and like to
go about unremarked.</p>

<p>I was so fond of that poor brown hat, too! It was
an incomparably obliging hat. It took any shape, and
adapted itself to any circumstances. It even went into
my pocket on occasions. I had bought it at Lincoln
&amp; Bennett&rsquo;s, if you please. But I had to give it up.
To my great regret, I saw that it was imperative: its
popularity bid fair to make me jealous. Twenty lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
about me, and half a column about that hat! It was
time to come to some determination. It was not to
be put up with any longer. So I took it up tenderly,
smoothed it with care, and laid it in a neat box which
was then posted to the chief editor of the paper with
the following note:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I see by your estimable paper that my hat has attracted a good
deal of public attention during its short sojourn in your city. I am
even tempted to think that it has attracted more of it than my
lecture. I send you the interesting headgear, and beg you will
accept it as a souvenir of my visit, and with my respectful compliments.</p></div>

<p>A citizen of the Great Republic knows how to take
a joke. The worthy editor inserted my letter in the
next number of his paper, and informed his readers
that my hat fitted him to a nicety, and that he was
going to have it dyed and wear it. He further said,
&ldquo;Max O&rsquo;Rell evidently thinks the song, &lsquo;Where did
you get that hat?&rsquo; was specially written to annoy
him,&rdquo; and went on to the effect that &ldquo;Max O&rsquo;Rell is
not the only man who does not care to tell where he
got his hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do not run away with the idea that such nonsense as
this has no interest for the American public. It has.</p>

<p>American reporters have asked me, with the most
serious face in the world, whether I worked in the
morning, afternoon, or evening, and what color paper
I used (<i>sic</i>). One actually asked me whether it was
true that M. Jules Claretie used white paper to write
his novels on, and blue paper for his newspaper articles.
Not having the honor of a personal acquaintance with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
the director of the Comédie-Française, I had to confess
my inability to gratify my amiable interlocutor.</p>

<p>Look at the advertisements in the newspapers.
There you have the bootmaker, the hatter, the traveling
quack, publishing their portraits at the head of
their advertisements. Why are those portraits there,
if it be not to satisfy the curiosity of customers?</p>

<p>The mass of personalities, each more trumpery than
the other, those details of people&rsquo;s private life, and all
the gossip daily served up in the newspapers, are they
not proof enough that curiosity is a characteristic trait
of the American?</p>

<p>This curiosity, which often shows itself in the most
impossible questions, gives immense amusement to
Europeans. Unhappily, it amuses them at the expense
of well-bred Americans&mdash;people who are as innocent
of it as the members of the stiffest aristocracy in
the world could be. The English, especially, persist
in not distinguishing Americans who are gentlemen
from Americans who are not.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>And even that easy-going American <i>bourgeois</i>, with
his childish but good-humored nature, they often fail
to do justice to. They too often look at his curiosity
as impertinence and ill-breeding, and will not admit
that, in nine cases out of ten, the freedom he uses
with you is but a show of good feeling, an act of good-fellowship.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the following little story:</p>

<p>An American is seated in a railway carriage, and
opposite him is a lady in deep mourning, and looking a
picture of sadness; a veritable <i>mater dolorosa</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost a father?&rdquo; begins the worthy fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mother, maybe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a child then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I have lost my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband! Ah! Left you comfortable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady, rather offended, retires to the other end
of the car, and cuts short the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather stuck up, this woman,&rdquo; remarks the good
Yankee to his neighbor.</p>

<p>The intention was good, if the way of showing it
was not. He had but wanted to show the poor lady
the interest he took in her.</p>

<p>After having seen you two or three times, the
American will suppress &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; and address you by
your name without any handle to it. Do not say that
this is ill placed familiarity; it is meant as an act of
good-fellowship, and should be received by you as
such.</p>

<p>If you are stiff, proud, and stuck-up, for goodness&rsquo;
sake, never go to America; you will never get on there.
On the contrary, take over a stock of simple, affable
manners and a good temper, and you will be treated
as a friend everywhere, fêted, and well looked after.</p>

<p>In fact, try to deserve a certificate of good-fellowship,
such as the Clover Club, of Philadelphia, awards
to those who can sit at its hospitable table without
taking affront at the little railleries leveled at them by
the members of that lively association. With people
of refinement who have humor, you can indulge in a
joke at their expense. So says La Bruyère. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
visitor to America, who wants to bring back a pleasant
recollection of his stay there, should lay this to heart.</p>

<p>Such are the impressions that I formed of the American
during my first trip to his country, and the more
I think over the matter, the more sure I am that
they were correct. Curiosity is his chief little failing,
and good-fellowship his most prominent quality. This
is the theme I will develop and send to the Editor of
the <i>North American Review</i>. I will profit by having a
couple of days to spend in New York to install myself
in a cosy corner of that cosiest of clubs, the &ldquo;Players,&rdquo;
and there write it.</p>

<p>It seems that, in the same number of this magazine,
the same subject is to be treated by Mr. Andrew Lang.
He has never seen Jonathan at home, and it will be interesting
to see what impressions he has formed of him
abroad. In the hands of such a graceful writer, the
&ldquo;typical American&rdquo; is sure to be treated in a pleasant
and interesting manner.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="tt">I am Asked to Express Myself Freely on
America&mdash;I Meet Mrs. Blank and for the
First Time Hear of Mr. Blank&mdash;Beacon Street
Society&mdash;The Boston Clubs.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Boston</i>, <i>January</i> 25.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">It</span> amuses me to notice how the Americans to whom
I have the pleasure of being introduced, refrain
from asking me what I think of America. But they
invariably inquire if the impressions of my first visit are
confirmed.</p>

<p>This afternoon, at an &ldquo;At Home,&rdquo; I met a lady from
New York, who asked me a most extraordinary question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read &lsquo;Jonathan and His Continent,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
said to me. &ldquo;I suppose that is a book of impressions
written for publication. But now, tell me <i>en confidence</i>,
what do you think of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything in that book,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;which
can make you suppose that it is not the faithful expression
of what the author thinks of America and
the Americans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is so complimentary, taken altogether,
that I must confess I had a lurking suspicion
of your having purposely flattered us and indulged our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
national weakness for hearing ourselves praised, so as
to make sure of a warm reception for your book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;by writing a flattering book
on any country, you would greatly increase your
chance of a large sale in that country; but, on the
other hand, you may write an abusive book on any
country and score a great success among that nation&rsquo;s
neighbors. For my part, I have always gone my own
quiet way, philosophizing rather than opinionating, and
when I write, it is not with the aim of pleasing any
particular public. I note down what I see, say what
I think, and people may read me or not, just as they
please. But I think I may boast, however, that my
pen is never bitter, and I do not care to criticise unless
I feel a certain amount of sympathy with the subject
of my criticism. If I felt that I could only honestly
say hard things of people, I would always abstain
altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said my fair questioner, &ldquo;how is it that you
have so little to say about our Fifth Avenue folks? Is it
because you have seen very little of them, or is it because
you could only have said hard things of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I saw a good deal of
them, but what I saw showed me that to describe them
would be only to describe polite society, as it exists in
London and elsewhere. Society gossip is not in my
line; boudoir and club smoking-room scandal has no
charm for me. Fifth Avenue resembles too much
Mayfair and Belgravia to make criticism of it worth
attempting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew this answer would have the effect of putting
me into the lady&rsquo;s good graces at once, and I was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
disappointed. She accorded to me her sweetest smile,
as I bowed to her to go and be introduced to another
lady by the mistress of the house.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:431px; height:430px" src="images/img164.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FIFTH AVENUE FOLK.</p></div>

<p>The next lady was a Bostonian. I had to explain to
her why I had not spoken of Beacon Street people,
using the same argument as in the case of Fifth Avenue
society, and with the same success.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>At the same &ldquo;At Home,&rdquo; I had the pleasure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
meeting Mrs. Blank, whom I had met many times in
London and Paris.</p>

<p>She is one of the crowd of pretty and clever women
whom America sends to brighten up European society,
and who reappear in London and Paris with the
regularity of the swallows. You meet them everywhere,
and conclude that they must be married, since
they are styled Mrs. and not Miss. But whether they
are wives, widows, or <i>divorcées</i>, you rarely think of inquiring,
and you may enjoy their friendship for years
without knowing whether they have a living lord or
not.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:493px; height:370px" src="images/img165.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A TELEPHONE AND TICKER.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Blank, as I say, is a most fascinating specimen
of America&rsquo;s daughters, and to-day I find that Mr.
Blank is also very much alive, but that the companions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
of his joys and sorrows are the telephone and the
ticker; in fact it is thanks to his devotion to these
that the wife of his bosom is able to adorn European
society during every recurring season.</p>

<p>American women have such love for freedom and
are so cool-headed that their visits to Europe could
not arouse suspicion even in the most malicious.
But, nevertheless, I am glad to have heard of Mr.
Blank, because it is comfortable to have one&rsquo;s mind at
rest on these subjects. Up to now, whenever I had
been asked, as sometimes happened, though seldom:
&ldquo;Who is Mr. Blank, and where is he?&rdquo; I had always
answered: &ldquo;Last puzzle out!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Lunched to-day in the beautiful Algonquin Club,
as the guest of Colonel Charles H. Taylor, and met the
editors of the other Boston papers, among whom was
John Boyle O&rsquo;Reilly,<a name="FnAnchor_1" id="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the lovely poet, and the delightful
man. The general conversation turned on two
subjects most interesting to me, viz., American journalism,
and American politics. All these gentlemen
seemed to agree that the American people take an
interest in local politics only, but not in imperial
politics, and this explains why the papers of the
smaller towns give detailed accounts of what is
going on in the houses of legislature of both city and
State, but do not concern themselves about what is
going on in Washington. I had come to that conclusion
myself, seeing that the great papers of New York,
Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago devoted columns to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
sayings and doings of the political world in London
and Paris, and seldom a paragraph to the sittings of
Congress in Washington.</p>

<p>In the morning, before lunch, I had called on Mr.
John Holmes, the editor of the Boston <i>Herald</i>, and
there met a talented lady who writes under the <i>nom de
plume</i> of &ldquo;Max Eliot,&rdquo; and with whom I had a delightful
half-hour&rsquo;s chat.</p>

<p>I have had to-day the pleasure of meeting the editors
of all the Boston newspapers.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In the evening, I dined with the members of the
New England Club, who meet every month to listen, at
dessert, to some interesting debate or lecture. The
wine is supplied by bets. You bet, for instance, that
the sun will shine on the following Friday at half-past
two. If you lose, you are one of those who will have
to supply one, two, or three bottles of champagne at
the next dinner, and so on. This evening the lecture,
or rather the short address, was given by Colonel Charles
H. Taylor on the history of American journalism. I
was particularly interested to hear the history of the
foundation of the New York <i>Herald</i>, by James Gordon
Bennett, and that of the New York <i>World</i>, by Mr.
Pulitzer, a Hungarian emigrant, who, some years ago,
arrived in the States, unable to speak English, became
jack-of-all-trades, then a reporter on a German paper,
proprietor of a Western paper, and then bought
the <i>World</i>, which is now one of the best paying concerns
in the whole of the United States. This man,
who, to maintain himself, not in health, but just alive,
is obliged to be constantly traveling, directs the paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
by telegraph from Australia, from Japan, from London,
or wherever he happens to be. It is nothing short of
marvelous.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I finished the evening in the St. Botolph Club, and
I may say that I have to-day spent one of the most
delightful days of my life, with those charming and
highly cultured Bostonians, who, a New York witty
friend of mine declares, &ldquo;are educated beyond their
intellects.&rdquo;</p>

Max.</p>

<p>A reception was given to me this afternoon by
Citizen George Francis Train, and I met many
artists, journalists, and a galaxy of charming
women.</p>

<p>The Citizen is pronounced to be the greatest crank
on earth. I found him decidedly eccentric, but entertaining,
witty, and a first-rate <i>raconteur</i>. He shakes
hands with you in the Chinese fashion&mdash;he shakes
his own. He has taken a solemn oath that his
body shall never come in contact with the body of
any one.</p>

<p>A charming programme of music and recitations
was gone through.</p>

<p>The invitation cards issued for the occasion speak
for themselves.

<p>It will be seen from the &ldquo;P. S.&rdquo; that the reception
could not be held at the Tremont House; but the
plucky Citizen did not allow himself to be beaten, and
the reception took place at the house of a friend.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In the evening I lectured in the Boston Theater to
a beautiful audience.</p>

<p>If there is a horrible fascination about &ldquo;the man
who won&rsquo;t smile,&rdquo; as I mentioned in a foregoing
chapter, there is a lovely fascination about the lady
who seems to enjoy your lecture thoroughly. You
watch the effects of your remarks on her face, and her
bright, intellectual eyes keep you in good form the
whole evening; in fact, you give the lecture to her. I
perhaps never felt the influence of that face more
powerfully than to-night. I had spoken for a few
minutes, when Madame Modjeska, accompanied by
her husband, arrived and took a seat on the first row
of the orchestra stalls. To be able to entertain the
great <i>tragédienne</i> became my sole aim, and as soon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
I perceived that I was successful, I felt perfectly proud
and happy. I lectured to her the whole evening.
Her laughter and applause encouraged me, her beautiful,
intellectual face cheered me up, and I was able to
introduce a little more acting and by-play than usual.</p>

<p>I had had the pleasure of making Madame Modjeska&rsquo;s
acquaintance two years ago, during my first
visit to the United States, and it was a great pleasure
to be able to renew it after the lecture.</p>

<p>I will go and see her <i>Ophelia</i> to-morrow night.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>January</i> 27.</p>

<p>Spent the whole morning wandering about Boston,
and visiting a few interesting places. Beacon Street,
the public gardens, and Commonwealth Avenue are
among the finest thoroughfares I know. What enormous
wealth is contained in those miles of huge
mansions!</p>

<p>The more I see Boston, the more it strikes me as a
great English city. It has a character of its own, as
no other American city has, excepting perhaps Washington
and Philadelphia. The solidity of the buildings,
the parks, the quietness of the women&rsquo;s dresses,
the absence of the twang in most of the voices, all
remind you of England.</p>

<p>After lunch I called on Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes.
The &ldquo;Autocrat of the Breakfast Table&rdquo; is now over
eighty, but he is as young as ever, and will die with a
kind smile on his face and a merry twinkle in his eyes.
I know no more delightful talker than this delightful
man. You may say of him that every time he talks
he says something. When he asked me what it was I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
had found most interesting in America, I wished I
could have answered: &ldquo;Why, my dear doctor, to see
and to hear such a man as you, to be sure!&rdquo; But the
doctor is so simple, so unaffected, that I felt an answer
of that kind, though perfectly sincere, would not have
been one calculated to please him. The articles
&ldquo;Over the Tea Cups,&rdquo; which he writes every month
for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and which will soon appear
in book form, are as bright, witty, humorous, and philosophic
as anything he ever wrote. Long may he
live to delight his native land!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In the evening I went to see Mr. Edwin Booth and
Madame Modjeska in &ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo; By far the two
greatest tragedians of America in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
greatest tragedy. I expected great things. I had
seen Mounet-Sully in the part, Henry Irving, Wilson
Barrett; and I remembered the witty French <i>quatrain</i>,
published on the occasion of Mounet-Sully attempting
the part:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Sans Fechter ni Rivière</p>
<p>Le cas était hasardeux;</p>
<p>Jamais, non jamais sur terre,</p>
<p>On n&rsquo;a fait d&rsquo;Hamlet sans eux.</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I had seen Mr. Booth three times before. As
<i>Brutus</i>, I thought he was excellent. As <i>Richelieu</i> he
was certainly magnificent; as <i>Iago</i> ideally superb.</p>

<p>His <i>Hamlet</i> was a revelation to me. After seeing
the raving <i>Hamlet</i> of Mounet-Sully, the somber <i>Hamlet</i>
of Irving, and the dreamy <i>Hamlet</i> of Wilson Barrett, I
saw this evening <i>Hamlet</i> the philosopher, the rhetorician.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span> </p>

<p>Mr. Booth is too old to play <i>Hamlet</i> as he does,
that is to say, without any attempt at making-up. He
puts on a black wig, and that is all, absolutely all. It
is, however, a most remarkable, subtle piece of acting
in his hands.</p>

<p>Madame Modjeska was beautiful as <i>Ophelia</i>. No
<i>tragédienne</i> that I have ever seen weeps more naturally.
In all sad situations she makes the chords of
one&rsquo;s heart vibrate, and that without any trick or artifice,
but simply by the modulations of her singularly
sympathetic voice and such like natural means.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that you can see in America, outside
of New York, more than one very good actor or
actress playing together. So you may imagine the
success of such a combination as Booth-Modjeska.</p>

<p>Every night the theater is packed from floor to ceiling,
although the prices of admission are doubled.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="tt">St. Johnsbury&mdash;The State of Maine&mdash;New England
Self-Control&mdash;Cold Climates and Frigid
Audiences&mdash;Where is the Audience?&mdash;All
Drunk!&mdash;A Reminiscence of a Scotch Audience
on a Saturday Night.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>St. Johnsbury (Vt.)</i>, <i>January</i> 28.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">St. Johnsbury</span> is a charming little town perched
on the top of a mountain, from which a lovely
scene of hills and woods can be enjoyed. The whole
country is covered with snow, and as I looked at it in
the evening by the electric light, the effect was very
beautiful. The town has only six thousand inhabitants,
eleven hundred of whom came to hear my lecture
to-night. Which is the European town of six
thousand inhabitants that would supply an audience
of eleven hundred people to a literary <i>causerie</i>?</p>

<p>St. Johnsbury has a dozen churches, a public library
of 15,000 volumes, with a reading-room beautifully
fitted with desks and perfectly adapted for study. A
museum, a Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association, with
gymnasium, school-rooms, reading-rooms, play-rooms,
and a lecture hall capable of accommodating over
1000 people. Who, after that, would consider himself
an exile if he had to live in St. Johnsbury? There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
more intellectual life in it than in any French town
outside of Paris and about a dozen more large cities.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Portsea, January</i> 30.</p>

<p>I have been in the State of Maine for two days; a
strange State to be in, let me tell you.</p>

<p>After addressing the Connecticut audience in Meriden
a few days ago, I thought I had had the experience
of the most frigid audience that could possibly
be gathered together. Last Tuesday night, at Portsea,
I was undeceived.</p>

<p>Half-way between St. Johnsbury and Portsea, the
day before yesterday, I was told that the train would
be very late, and would not arrive at Portsea before
half-past eight. My lecture in that city was to begin
at eight. The only thing to do was to send a telegram
to the manager of the lecture. At the next station I
sent the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Train late. If possible, keep audience waiting
half an hour. Will dress on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I dressed in the state-room of the parlor-car. At
forty minutes past eight the train arrived at Portsea.
I immediately jumped into a cab and drove to the
City Hall, where the lecture was to take place. The
building was lighted, but, as I ascended the stairs,
there was not a person to be seen or a sound to be
heard. &ldquo;The place is deserted,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;and if
anybody came to hear me, they have all gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened the door of the private room behind the
platform and there found the manager, who expressed
his delight to see me. I excused myself, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
going to enter into a
detailed explanation
when he interrupted:</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:198px; height:500px" src="images/img178.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">I TIP-TOED OUT.</td></tr></table>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Have
you got an audience
there, on the other side
of that door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we have got
fifteen hundred people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There?&rdquo; said I,
pointing to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, on the other
side of that door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t hear a
sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you can&rsquo;t.
But that&rsquo;s all right;
they are there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I had better apologize
to them for keeping
them waiting three-quarters
of an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just as you
please,&rdquo; said the manager.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I guess they
would have waited another half-hour without showing
any sign of impatience.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span> </p>

<p>I opened the door trembling. My desk was far, far
away. My manager was right; the audience was there.
I stepped on the platform, shut the door after me,
making as little noise as I could, and, walking on tiptoe
so as to wake up as few people as possible, proceeded
toward the table. Not one person applauded. A few
people looked up unconcernedly, as if to say, &ldquo;I guess
that&rsquo;s the show.&rdquo; The rest seemed asleep, although
their eyes were open.</p>

<p>Arrived at the desk, I faced the audience, and ventured
a little joke, which fell dead flat.</p>

<p>I began to realize the treat that was in store for me
that night.</p>

<p>I tried another little joke, and&mdash;missed fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, old fellow,&rdquo; I said to myself; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
two hundred and fifty dollars; go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I went on.</p>

<p>I saw a few people smile, but not one laughed, although
I noticed that a good many were holding their
handkerchiefs over their mouths, probably to stifle any
attempt at such a frivolous thing as laughter. The
eyes of the audience, which I always watch, showed
signs of interest, and nobody left the hall until the
conclusion of the lecture. When I had finished, I
made a small bow, when certainly fifty people
applauded. I imagined they were glad it was all over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said to the manager, when I had returned
to the little back room, &ldquo;I suppose we must call this a
failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A failure!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing of the sort. Why,
I have never seen them so enthusiastic in my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went to the hotel, and tried to forget the audience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
I had just had by recalling to my mind a joyous evening
in Scotland. This happened about a year ago, in
a mining town in the neighborhood of Glasgow, where
I had been invited to lecture, on a Saturday night, to
the members of a popular&mdash;very popular&mdash;Institute.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:518px; height:430px" src="images/img180.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I AM ESCORTED TO THE HALL.</p></div>

<p>I arrived at the station from Glasgow at half-past
seven, and there found the secretary and the treasurer of
the Institute, who had been kind enough to come and
meet me. We shook hands. They gave me a few
words of welcome. I thought my friends looked a
little bit queer. They proposed that we should walk to
the lecture hall. The secretary took my right arm, the
treasurer took my left, and, abreast, the three of us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
proceeded toward the hall. They did not take me to
that place; <i>I</i> took them, holding them fast all the way&mdash;the
treasurer especially.</p>

<p>We arrived in good time, although we stopped once
for light refreshment. At eight punctually, I entered
the hall, preceded by the president, and followed by
the members of the committee. The president introduced
me in a most queer, incoherent speech. I rose,
and was vociferously cheered. When silence was restored,
I said in a calm, almost solemn manner: &ldquo;Ladies
and Gentlemen.&rdquo; This was the signal for more cheering
and whistling. In France whistling means hissing,
and I began to feel uneasy, but soon I bore in mind
that whistling, in the North of Great Britain, was used
to express the highest pitch of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>So I went on.</p>

<p>The audience laughed at everything I said, and even
before I said it. I had never addressed such keen
people. They seemed so anxious to laugh and cheer
in the right place that they laughed and cheered all
the time&mdash;so much so that in an hour and twenty
minutes, I had only got through half my lecture, which
I had to bring to a speedy conclusion.</p>

<p>The president rose and proposed a vote of thanks in
another most queer speech, which was a new occasion
for cheering.</p>

<p>When we had retired in the committee room, I said
to the secretary: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the president?
Is he quite right?&rdquo; I added, touching my
forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the secretary, striking his chest as
proudly as possible, &ldquo;he is drunk&mdash;and so am I.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:412px; height:610px" src="images/img182.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;HE&rsquo;S DRUNK, AND SO AM I.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span> </p>

<p>The explanation of the whole strange evening
dawned upon me. Of course they were drunk, and
so was the audience.</p>

<p>That night, I believe I was the only sober person on
the premises.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had an interesting chat with a native of
the State of Maine on the subject of my lecture at
Portsea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly wrong,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;in supposing
that your lecture was not appreciated. I was
present, and I can assure you that the attentive silence
in which they listened to you from beginning to end is
the proof that they appreciated you. You would also
be wrong in supposing that they do not appreciate
humor. On the contrary, they are very keen of it,
and I believe that the old New Englander was the
father of American humor, through the solemn
manner in which he told comic things, and the
comic manner in which he told the most serious
ones. Yes, they are keen of humor, and their apparent
want of appreciation is only due to reserve,
to self-control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as an illustration of it, my friend told me the
following anecdote which, I have no doubt, a good
many Americans have heard before:</p>

<p>Mark Twain had lectured to a Maine audience without
raising a single laugh in his listeners, when, at the
close, he was thanked by a gentleman who came to
him in the green-room, to tell him how hugely every
one had enjoyed his amusing stories. When the lecturer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
expressed his surprise at this announcement,
as the audience had not laughed, the gentleman
added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we never were so amused in our lives, and if
you had gone on five minutes more, upon my word
I don&rsquo;t think we could have held out any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such is New England self-control.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="tt">A Lovely Ride to Canada&mdash;Quebec, a Corner
of Old France Strayed up and Lost in the
Snow&mdash;The French Canadians&mdash;The Parties
in Canada&mdash;Will the Canadians Become Yankees?</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Montreal</i>, <i>February</i> 1.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">The</span> ride from the State of Maine to Montreal is
very picturesque, even in the winter. It offers
you four or five hours of Alpine scenery through the
American Switzerland. The White Mountains, commanded
by Mount Washington, are, for a distance of
about forty miles, as wild and imposing as anything
the real Switzerland can supply the tourist. Gorges,
precipices, torrents, nothing is wanting.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole time we journeyed across pine
forests, coming, now and then, across saw mills, and
little towns looking like bee-hives of activity. Now
there was an opening, and frozen rivers, covered with
snow, formed, with the fields, a huge uniform mass of
dazzling whiteness. The effect, under a pure blue sky
and in a perfectly clear atmosphere, was very beautiful.
Now the country became hilly again. On the slopes,
right down to the bottom of the valley, we saw Berlin
Falls, bathing its feet in the river. The yellow houses
with their red roofs and gables, rest the eyes from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
long stretch of blue and white. How beautiful this
town and its surroundings must be in the fall, when
Dame Nature in America puts on her cloak of gold
and scarlet! All the country on the line we traveled
is engaged in the lumber trade.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 280px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:226px; height:310px" src="images/img186.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">THE AMIABLE CONDUCTOR.</td></tr></table>

<p>For once I had an amiable conductor in the parlor
car; even more than
amiable&mdash;quite friendly
and familiar. He put
his arms on my shoulders
and got quite patronizing.
I did not
mind that a bit. I hate
anonymous landscapes,
and he explained and
named everything to
me. My innocence of
American things in
general touched him.
He was a great treat
after those &ldquo;ill-licked
bears&rdquo; that you so
often come across in
the American cars. He went further than that: he
kindly recommended me to the Canadian custom-house
officers, when we arrived at the frontier, and
the examination of my trunk and valise did not last
half a minute.</p>

<p>Altogether, the long journey passed rapidly and
agreeably. We were only two people in the parlor
car, and my traveling companion proved a very pleasant
man. First, I did not care for the look of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
He had a new silk hat on, a multicolored satin cravat
with a huge diamond pin fixed in it; a waistcoat covered
with silk embroidery work, green, blue, and pink;
a coat with silk facings, patent-leather boots. Altogether,
he was rather dressed for a garden party (in
more than doubtful taste) than for a fifteen hours&rsquo; railway
journey. But in America the cars are so luxurious
and kept so warm that traveling dresses are not known
in the country. Ulsters, cloaks, rugs, garments made
of tweed and rough materials, all these things are unnecessary
and therefore unknown. I soon found out,
however, that this quaintly got-up man was interesting
to speak to. He knew every bit of the country we
passed, and, being easily drawn out, he poured into my
ears information that was as rapid as it was valuable. He
was well read and had been to Europe several times.
He spoke of France with great enthusiasm, which enrolled
my sympathy, and he had enjoyed my lecture,
which, you may imagine, secured for his intelligence
and his good taste my boundless admiration. When
we arrived at Montreal, we were a pair of friends.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I begin my Canadian tour here on Monday and then
shall go West. I was in Quebec two years ago; but
the dear old place is not on my list this time. No
words could express my regret. I shall never forget
my feelings on landing under the great cliff on which
stands the citadel, and on driving, bumped along in a
sleigh over the half-thawed snow, in the street that
lies under the fortress, and on through the other quaint
winding steep streets, and again under the majestic
archways to the upper town, where I was set down at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
the door of the Florence, a quiet, delightful little hotel
that the visitor to Quebec should not fail to stop at, if
he like home comforts and care to enjoy magnificent
scenery from his window. It seemed as though I was
in France, in my dear old Brittany. It looked like St.
Malo strayed up here and lost in the snow. The illusion
became complete when I saw the gray houses,
heard the people talk with the Breton intonation, and
saw over the shops Langlois, Maillard, Clouet, and all
the names familiar to my childhood. But why say
&ldquo;illusion&rdquo;? It was a fact: I was in France. These
folks have given their faith to England, but, as the
Canadian poet says, they have kept their hearts for
France. Not only their hearts, but their manners and
their language. Oh, there was such pleasure in it all!
The lovely weather, the beautiful scenery, the kind welcome
given to me, the delight of seeing these children
of Old France, more than three thousand miles from
home, happy and thriving&mdash;a feast for the eyes, a feast
for the heart. And the drive to Montmorency Falls
in the sleigh, gliding smoothly along on the hard snow!
And the sleighs laden with wood for the Quebec folks,
the carmen stimulating their horses with a <i>hue là</i> or <i>hue
donc</i>! And the return to the Florence, where a good
dinner served in a private room awaited us! And that
polite, quiet, attentive French girl who waited on us,
the antipodes of the young Yankee lady who makes
you sorry that breakfasting and dining are necessary,
in some American hotels, and whose waiting is like
taking sand and vinegar with your food!</p>

<p>The mere spanking along through the cold, brisk
air, when you are well muffled in furs is exhilarating,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
especially when the sun is shining in a cloudless blue
sky. The beautiful scenery at Quebec was, besides, a
feast for eyes tired with the monotonous flatness of
America. The old city is on a perfect mountain, and
as we came bumping down its side in our sleigh over
the roads which were there in a perfect state of sherbet,
there was a lovely picture spread out in front of
us. In the distance the bluest mountains I ever saw
(to paint them one must use pure cobalt); away to the
right the frozen St. Lawrence and the Isle of Orléans,
all snow-covered, of course, but yet distinguishable
from the farm lands of Jacques Bonhomme, whose
cosy, clean cottages we soon began to pass. The long,
ribbon-like strips of farm were indicated by the tops of
the fences peeping through the snow, and told us of
French thrift and prosperity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:339px; height:320px" src="images/img189.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THAT QUIET, ATTENTIVE FRENCH GIRL.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span> </p>

<p>Yes, it was all delightful. When I left Quebec I felt
as much regret as I do every time that I leave my little
native town.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I have been told that the works of Voltaire are prohibited
in Quebec, not so much because they are irreligious
as because they were written by a man who,
after the loss of Quebec to the French Crown, exclaimed:
&ldquo;Let us not be concerned about the loss of
a few acres of snow.&rdquo; The memory of Voltaire is
execrated, and for having made a flattering reference
to him on the platform in Montreal two years ago, I
was near being &ldquo;boycotted&rdquo; by the French population.</p>

<p>The French Canadians take very little interest in
politics&mdash;I mean in outside politics. They are steady,
industrious, saving, peaceful, and so long as the English
leave them alone, in the safe enjoyment of their
belongings, they will not give them cause for any
anxiety. Among the French Canadians there is no
desire for annexation to the United States. Indeed,
during the War of Independence, Canada was saved to
the English Crown by the French Canadians, not because
the latter loved the English, but because they
hated the Yankees. When Lafayette took it for
granted that the French Canadians would rally round
his flag, he made a great mistake; they would have, if
compelled to fight, used their bullets against the
Americans. If they had their own way, the French in
Canada would set up a little country of their own
under the rule of the Catholic Church, a little corner
of France two hundred years old.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span> </p>

<p>The education of the lower classes is at a very low
stage; thirty per cent. of the children of school age in
Quebec do not attend school. The English dare not
introduce gratuitous and compulsory education. They
have an understanding with the Catholic Church,
which insists upon exercising entire control over public
education. The Quebec schools are little more than
branches of the confessional box. The English shut
their eyes, for part of the understanding with the
Church is that the latter will keep loyalty to the English
Crown alive among her submissive flock.</p>

<p>The tyranny exercised by the Catholic Church may
easily be imagined from the following newspaper extract:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>A well-to-do butcher of Montreal attended the Catholic Church
at Ile Perrault last Sunday. He was suffering at the time with
acute cramps, and when that part of the service arrived during
which the congregation kneel, he found himself unable to do more
than assume a reclining devotional position, with one knee on the
floor. His action was noticed, and the church-warden, in concert
with others, had him brought before the court charged with an act
of irreverence, and he was fined $8 and costs.</p></div>

<p>Such a judgment does not only expose the tyranny
of the Catholic Church, but the complicity of the
English, who uphold Romanism in the Province of
Quebec as they uphold Buddhism in India, so as not
to endanger the security of their possessions.</p>

<p>The French Canadians are multiplying so rapidly
that in a very few years the Province of Quebec will
be as French as the town of Quebec itself. Every day
they push their advance from east to west. They
generally marry very young. When a lad is seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
the company of a girl, he is asked by the priest if he is
courting that girl. In which case he is bidden to go
straightway to the altar, and these young couples rear
families of twelve and fifteen children, none of whom
leave the country. The English have to make room
for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:359px; height:430px" src="images/img192.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIEST.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span></p>

<p>The average attendance in Catholic churches on
Sundays in Montreal is 111,483; in the sixty churches
that belong to the different Protestant denominations,
the average attendance is 34,428. The former number
has been steadily increasing, the latter steadily decreasing.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>What is the future reserved to French Canada, and
indeed to the whole Dominion?</p>

<p>There are only two political parties, Liberals and
Conservatives, but I find the population divided into
four camps: Those in favor of Canada, an independent
nation; those in favor of the political union of
Canada and the United States; those in favor of Canada
going into Imperial Federation, and those in favor
of Canada remaining an English colony, or in other
words, in favor of the actual state of things.</p>

<p>Of course the French Canadians are dead against
going into Imperial Federation, which would simply
crush them, and Canadian &ldquo;society&rdquo; is in favor of remaining
English. The other Canadians seem pretty
equally divided.</p>

<p>It must be said that the annexation idea has been
making rapid progress of late years, among prominent
men as well as among the people. The Americans
will never fire one shot to have the idea realized. If
ever the union becomes an accomplished fact, it will become
so with the assent of all parties. The task will
be made easy through Canada and the United States
having the same legislature. The local and provincial
governments are the same in the Canadian towns and
provinces as they are in the American towns and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
States&mdash;a House of Representatives, a Senate, and a
Governor, with this difference, this great difference,
to the present advantage of Canada: whereas every
four years the Americans elect a new master, who appoints
a ministry responsible to himself alone, the
Canadians have a ministry responsible to their parliament,
that is, to themselves. The representation of
the American people at Washington is democratic, but
the government is autocratic. In Canada, both legislature
and executive are democratic, as in England,
that greatest and truest of all democracies.</p>

<p>The change in Canada would have to be made on
the American plan.</p>

<p>With the exception of Quebec and parts of Montreal,
Canada is built like America; the country has
the same aspect, the currency is the same. Suppress
the Governor-General in Ottawa, who is there to remind
Canada that she is a dependency of the English
Crown, strew the country with more cuspidores, and
you have part of Jonathan&rsquo;s big farm.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="tt">Montreal&mdash;The City&mdash;Mount Royal&mdash;Canadian
Sports&mdash;Ottawa&mdash;The Government&mdash;Rideau
Hall.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Montreal</i>, <i>February</i> 2.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Montreal</span> is a large and well-built city, containing
many buildings of importance, mostly
churches, of which about thirty are Roman Catholic,
and over sixty are devoted to Protestant worship, in
all its branches and variations, from the Anglican
church to the Salvation Army.</p>

<p>I arrived at a station situated on a level with the
St. Lawrence River. From it, we mounted in an omnibus
up, up, up, through narrow streets full of shops
with Breton or Norman names over them, as in Quebec;
on through broader ones, where the shops grew
larger and the names became more frequently English;
on, on, till I thought Montreal had no end, and, at last
alighted on a great square, and found myself at the
door of the Windsor Hotel, an enormous and fine
construction, which has proved the most comfortable,
and, in every respect the best hotel I have yet stopped
at on the great American continent. It is about a
quarter of a mile from my bedroom to the dining-hall,
which could, I believe, accommodate nearly a thousand
guests.</p>

<p>My first visit was to an afternoon &ldquo;At Home,&rdquo; given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
by the St. George&rsquo;s Club, who have a club-house high
up on Mount Royal. It was a ladies&rsquo; day, and there was
music, dancing, etc. We went in a sleigh up the very
steep hill, much to my astonishment. I should have
thought the thing practically impossible. On our way
we passed a toboggan slide down the side of Mount
Royal. It took my breath away to think of coming
down it at the rate
of over a mile a minute.
The view from
the club-house was
splendid, taking in a
great sweep of snow-covered
country, the
city and the frozen
St. Lawrence. There
are daily races on the
river, and last year
they ran tram-cars
on it.</p>

<p>It was odd to hear
the phrase, &ldquo;after the flood.&rdquo; When I came to
inquire into it, I learned that when the St. Lawrence
ice breaks up, the lower city is flooded, and this is
yearly spoken of as &ldquo;the flood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I drove back from the club with my manager and
two English gentlemen, who are here on a visit. As
we passed the toboggan slide, my manager told me of
an old gentleman over sixty, who delights in those
breathless passages down the side of Mount Royal.
One may see him out there &ldquo;at it,&rdquo; as early as ten in
the morning. Plenty of people, however, try one ride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
and never ask for another. One gentleman my manager
told me of, after having tried it, expressed pretty
well the feelings of many others. He said, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
do it again for two thousand dollars, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
have missed it for three.&rdquo; I asked one of the two Englishmen
who accompanied us, whether he had had a
try. He was a
quiet, solemn,
middle-aged Englishman.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;yes, I
have. It had to
be done, and I
did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last night I was
most interested in
watching the members
of the Snowshoe
Club start
from the Windsor,
on a kind of a
picnic over the
country. Their
costumes were
very picturesque;
a short tunic of woolen material fastened round the
waist by a belt, a sort of woolen nightcap, with tassel
falling on the shoulder, thick woolen stockings, and
knickerbockers.</p>

<p>In Russia and the northern parts of the United States,
the people say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold to go out.&rdquo; In Canada,
they say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very cold, let&rsquo;s all go out.&rdquo; Only rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
keeps them indoors. In the coldest weather, with a temperature
of many degrees below zero, you have great
difficulty in finding a closed carriage. All, or nearly
all, are open sleighs. The driver wraps you up in
furs, and as you go, gliding on the snow, your face is
whipped by the cold air, you feel glowing all over
with warmth, and altogether the sensation is delightful.</p>

<p>This morning, Joseph Howarth, the talented American
actor, breakfasted with me and a few friends.
Last night, I went to see him play in Steele Mackaye&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Paul Kauvar.&rdquo; Canada has no actors worth mentioning,
and the people here depend on American artists
for all their entertainments. It is wonderful how the
feeling of independence engenders and develops the
activity of the mind in a country. Art and literature
want a home of their own, and do not flourish in
other people&rsquo;s houses. Canada has produced nothing
in literature: the only two poets she can boast are
French, Louis Fréchette and Octave Crémazie. It is
not because Canada has no time for brain productions.
America is just as busy as she is, felling forests and
reclaiming the land; but free America, only a hundred
years old as a nation, possesses already a list of historians,
novelists, poets, and essayists, that would do
honor to any nation in the world.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>February</i> 4.</p>

<p>I had capital houses in the Queen&rsquo;s Hall last night
and to-night.</p>

<p>The Canadian audiences are more demonstrative
than the American ones, and certainly quite as keen
and appreciative. When you arrive on the platform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
they are glad to see you, and they let you know it; a
fact which in America, in New England especially,
you have to find out for yourself.</p>

<p>Montreal possesses a very wealthy and fashionable
community, and what strikes me most, coming as I do
from the United States, is the stylish simplicity of the
women. I am told that Canadian women in their
tastes and ways have always been far more English
than American, and that the fashions have grown
more and more simple since Princess Louise gave the
example of always dressing quietly when occupying
Rideau Hall in Ottawa.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Ottawa</i>, <i>February</i> 5.</p>

<p>One of the finest sights I have yet seen in this
country was from the bridge on my way from the
station to the Russell this morning. On the right the
waterfalls, on the left, on the top of a high and almost
perpendicular rock, the Houses of Parliament, a grand
pile of buildings in gray stone, standing out clear
against a cloudless, intense blue sky. The Russell is
one of those huge babylonian hotels so common on
the American continent, where unfortunately the
cookery is not on a level with the architectural pretensions;
but most of the leading Canadian politicians are
boarding here while Parliament is sitting, and I am
interested to see them.</p>

<p>After visiting the beautiful library and other parts
of the government buildings, I had the good luck to
hear, in the House of Representatives, a debate between
Mr. Chapleau, a minister and one of the leaders
of the Conservatives now in office, and Mr. Laurier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
one of the chiefs of the Opposition. Both gentlemen
are French. It was a fight between a tribune and a
scholar; between a short, thickset, long-maned lion,
and a tall, slender, delicate fox.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE RADIANT, LOVELY CANADIENNE.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>After lunch, I went to Rideau Hall, the residence of
the Governor-General, Lord Stanley of Preston. The
executive mansion stands in a pretty park well wooded
with firs, a mile out of the town. His Excellency was
out, but his aid-de-camp, to whom I had a letter of
introduction, most kindly showed me over the place.
Nothing can be more simple and unpretentious than
the interior of Rideau Hall. It is furnished like any
comfortable little provincial hotel patronized by the
gentry of the neighborhood. The panels of the drawing-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
were painted by Princess Louise, when she
occupied the house with the Marquis of Lorne some
eight or ten years ago. This is the only touch of
luxury about the place. In the time of Lord Dufferin,
a ball-room and a tennis court were added to the building,
and these are among the many souvenirs of his
popular rule. As a diplomatist, as a viceroy, and as
an ambassador, history will one day record that this
noble son of Erin never made a mistake.</p>

<p>In the evening, I lectured in the Opera House to a
large audience.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Kingston</i>, <i>February</i> 6.</p>

<p>This morning, at the Russell, I was called at the
telephone. It was His Excellency, who was asking me
to lunch at Rideau Hall. I felt sorry to be obliged to
leave Ottawa, and thus forego so tempting an invitation.</p>

<p>Kingston is a pretty little town on the border of
Lake Ontario, possessing a university, a penitentiary,
and a lunatic asylum, in neither of which I made my
appearance to-night. But as soon as I had started
speaking on the platform of the Town Hall, I began to
think the doors of the lunatic asylum had been carelessly
left open that night, for close under the window
behind the platform, there began a noise which was
like Bedlam let loose. Bedlam with trumpets and
other instruments of torture. It was impossible to go
on with the lecture, so I stopped. On inquiry, the
unearthly din was found to proceed from a detachment
of the Salvation Army outside the building. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
some parleying, they consented to move on and storm
some other citadel.</p>

<p>But it was a stormy evening, and peace was not yet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:379px; height:470px" src="images/img202.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A SALVATIONIST.</p></div>

<p>As soon as I had fairly restarted, a person in the
audience began to show signs of disapproval, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
twice or thrice he gave vent to his disapproval rather
loudly.</p>

<p>I was not surprised to learn, at the close of the evening,
that this individual had come in with a free pass.
He had been admitted on the strength of his being announced
to give a &ldquo;show&rdquo; of some sort himself a week
later in the hall.</p>

<p>If a man is inattentive or creates a disturbance at
any performance, you may take it for granted that his
ticket was given to him.  He never paid for it.</p>

<p>To-morrow I go to Toronto, where I am to give two
lectures. I had not time to see that city properly on
my last visit to Canada, and all my friends prophesy
that I shall have a good time.</p>

<p>So does the advance booking, I understand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="tt">Toronto&mdash;The City&mdash;The Ladies&mdash;The Sports&mdash;Strange
Contrasts&mdash;The Canadian Schools.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Toronto</i>, <i>February</i> 9.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Have</span> passed three very pleasant days in this city,
and had two beautiful audiences in the Pavilion.</p>

<p>Toronto is a thoroughly American city in appearance,
but only in appearance, for I find the inhabitants
British in heart, in tastes, and habits. When I say
that it is an American city, I mean to say that Toronto
is a large area, covered with blocks of parallelograms
and dirty streets, overspread with tangles of telegraph
and telephone wires. The hotels are perfectly American
in every respect.</p>

<p>The suburbs are exceedingly pretty. Here once
more are fine villas standing in large gardens, a sight
rarely seen near an American city. It reminds me of
England. I admire many buildings, the University<a name="FnAnchor_2" id="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
especially.</p>

<p>English-looking, too, are the rosy faces of the Toronto
ladies whom I passed in my drive. How charming
they are with the peach-like bloom that their outdoor
exercise gives them!</p>

<p>I should like to be able to describe, as it deserves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
the sight of these Canadian women in their sleighs, as
the horses fly along with bells merrily jingling, the
coachman in his curly black dogskin and huge busby
on his head. Furs float over the back of the sleigh,
and, in it, muffled up to the chin in sumptuous skins
and also capped in furs, sits the radiant, lovely Canadienne,
the milk and roses of her complexion enhanced
by the proximity of the dark furs. As they skim past
over the white snow, under a glorious sunlit blue sky,
I can call to mind no prettier sight, no more beautiful
picture, to be seen on this huge continent, so far as I
have got yet.</p>

<p>One cannot help being struck, on coming here from
the United States, at the number of lady pedestrians
in the streets. They are not merely shopping, I am
assured, nor going straight from one point to another
of the town, but taking their constitutional walks in
true English fashion. My impresario took me in the
afternoon to a club for ladies and gentlemen, and
there I had the, to me, novel sight of a game of hockey.
On a large frozen pond there was a party of young
people engaged in this graceful and invigorating game,
and not far off was a group of little girls and boys imitating
their elders very sensibly and, as it seemed to
me, successfully. The clear, healthy complexion of
the Canadian women is easy to account for, when one
sees how deep-rooted, even after transplantation, is the
good British love of exercise in the open air.</p>

<p>Last evening I was taken to a ball, and was able to
see more of the Canadian ladies than is possible in
furs, and on further acquaintance I found them as delightful
in manners as in appearance; English in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
coloring and in their simplicity of dress, American in
their natural bearing and in their frankness of speech.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:265px; height:430px" src="images/img206.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A HOCKEY PLAYER.</p></div>

<p>Churches, churches, everywhere. In my drive this
afternoon, I counted twenty-eight in a quarter of an
hour. They are of all denominations, Catholic, Anglican,
Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, etc., etc. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
Canadians must be still more religious&mdash;I mean still
more church-going&mdash;than the English.</p>

<p>From seven in the evening on Saturday, all the taverns
are closed, and remain closed throughout Sunday.
In England the Bible has to compete with the gin
bottle, but here the Bible has all its own way on Sundays.
Neither tram-car, omnibus, cab, nor hired carriage
of any description is to be seen abroad. Scotland
itself is outdone completely; the land of John Knox
has to take a back seat.</p>

<p>The walls of this city of churches and chapels are at
the present moment covered with huge coarse posters
announcing in loud colors the arrival of a company of
performing women. Of these posters, one represents
Cleopatra in a bark drawn through the water by
nude female slaves. Another shows a cavalcade of
women dressed in little more than a fig-leaf. Yet another
represents the booking-office of the theater
stormed by a crowd of <i>blasé</i>-looking, single eye-glassed
old <i>beaux</i>, grinning with pleasure in anticipation of
the show within. Another poster displays the charms
of the proprietress of the undertaking. You must
not, however, imagine any harm of the performers
whose attractions are so liberally placarded. They
are taken to their cars in the depot immediately
after the performance and locked up; there is an
announcement to that effect. These placards are
merely eye-ticklers. But this mixture of churches,
strict sabbatarianism, and posters of this kind, is
part of the eternal history of the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;violent
contrast.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span> </p>

<p>A school inspector has kindly shown me several
schools in the town.</p>

<p>The children of rich and poor alike are educated
together in the public schools, from which they get
promoted to the high schools. All these schools are
free. Boys and girls sit on the same benches and receive
the same education, as in the United States.
This enables the women in the New World to compete
with men for all the posts that we Europeans
consider the monopoly of man; it also enables them
to enjoy all the intellectual pleasures of life. If it
does not prevent them, as it has yet to be proved
that it does, from being good wives and mothers, the
educational system of the New World is much superior
to the European one. It is essentially democratic.
Europe will have to adopt it.</p>

<p>Society in the Old World will not stand long on its
present basis. There will always be rich and poor, but
every child that is born will require to be given a
chance, and, according as he avails himself of it or
not, will be successful or a failure. But give him a
chance, and the greatest and most real grievance of
mankind in the present day will be removed.</p>

<p>Every child that is born in America, whether in the
United States or in Canada, has that chance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="tt">West Canada&mdash;Relations between British and
Indians&mdash;Return to the United States&mdash;Difficulties
in the Way&mdash;Encounter with
an American Custom-House Officer.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>In the train from Canada to Chicago</i>, <i>February</i> 15.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Lectured</span> in Bowmanville, Ont., on the 12th,
in Brantford on the 13th, and in Sarnia on the
14th, and am now on my way to Chicago, to go from
there to Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p>

<p>From Brantford I drove to the Indian Reservation,
a few miles from the town. This visit explained to
me why the English are so successful with their
colonies: they have inborn in them the instinct of
diplomacy and government.</p>

<p>Whereas the Americans often swindle, starve, and
shoot the Indians, the English keep them in comfort.
England makes paupers and lazy drunkards of them,
and they quietly and gradually disappear. She supplies
them with bread, food, Bibles, and fire-water,
and they become so lazy that they will not even
take the trouble to sow the land of their reservations.
Having a dinner supplied to them, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
give up hunting, riding, and all their native sports,
and become enervated. They go to school and die
of attacks of civilization. England gives them
money to celebrate their national fêtes and rejoicings,
and the good Indians shout at the top of
their voices, <i>God save the Queen!</i> that is&mdash;<i>God save
our pensions!</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:508px; height:400px" src="images/img210.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE BRITISH INDIAN.</p></div>

<p>England, or Great Britain, or again, if you prefer,
Greater Britain, goes further than that. In Brantford,
in the middle of a large square, you can see the statue
of the Indian chief Brant, erected to his memory by
public subscriptions collected among the British
Canadians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span> </p>

<p>Here lies the secret of John Bull&rsquo;s success as a
colonizer. To erect a statue to an Indian chief is a
stroke of genius.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>What has struck me as most American in Canada is,
perhaps, journalism.</p>

<p>Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec possess excellent
newspapers, and every little town can boast one
or two journals.</p>

<p>The tone of these papers is thoroughly American
in its liveliness&mdash;I had almost said, in its
loudness. All are readable and most cleverly
edited. Each paragraph is preceded by a neat
and attractive heading. As in the American papers,
the editorials, or leading articles, are of secondary
importance. The main portion of the publication
is devoted to news, interviews, stories, gossip, jokes,
anecdotes, etc.</p>

<p>The Montreal papers are read by everybody in the
Province of Quebec, and the Toronto papers in the
Province of Ontario, so that the newspapers published
in small towns are content with giving all the news of
the locality. Each of these has a &ldquo;society&rdquo; column.
Nothing is more amusing than to read of the society
doings in these little towns. &ldquo;Miss Brown is visiting
Miss Smith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Miss Smith had tea with Miss Robinson
yesterday.&rdquo; When Miss Brown, or Miss Smith,
or Miss Robinson has given a party, the names of all
the guests are inserted as well as what they had for
dinner, or for supper, as the case may be. So I take
it for granted that when anybody gives a party, a ball,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
a dinner, a reporter receives an invitation to describe
the party in the next issue of the paper.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock this evening, I left Sarnia, on the
frontier of Canada, to cross the river and pass into the
United States. The train left the town, and, on
arriving on the bank of the River St. Clair, was divided
into two sections which were run on board the ferry-boat
and made the crossing side by side. The passage
across the river occupied about twenty minutes. On
arriving at the other bank, at Port Huron, in the State
of Michigan, the train left the boat in the same fashion
as it had gone on board, the two parts were coupled
together, and the journey on <i>terra firma</i> was smoothly
resumed.</p>

<p>There is something fascinating about crossing a
river at night, and I had promised myself some agreeable
moments on board the ferry-boat, from which I
should be able to see Port Huron lit up with twinkling
lights. I was also curious to watch the train boarding
the boat. But, alas, I had reckoned without my host.
Instead of star-gazing and <i>rêverie</i>, there was in store
for me a &ldquo;bad quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had the train boarded the ferry-boat than
there came to the door of the parlor car a surly-looking,
ill-mannered creature, who roughly bade me come
to the baggage van, in the other section of the train,
and open my trunks for him to inspect.</p>

<p>As soon as I had complied, he went down on his
knees among my baggage, and it was plain to see that
he meant business.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span> </p>

<p>The first thing he took out was a suit of clothes,
which he threw on the dirty floor of the van.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have these been worn?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>Then he took out a blue jacket which I used to
cross the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:391px; height:430px" src="images/img213.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;HAVE YOU WORN THIS?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Have you worn this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the last two years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he said, with a low sardonic grin.</p>

<p>My trunk was the only one he had to examine,
as I was the only passenger in the parlor car; and I
saw that he meant to annoy me, which, I imagined, he
could do with perfect impunity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span> </p>

<p>The best thing, in fact, the only thing to do was to
take the misadventure good-humoredly.</p>

<p>He took out my linen and examined it in
detail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have these shirts all been worn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess they have. But how is it that you,
an official of the government, seem to ignore the law
of your own country? Don&rsquo;t you know that if all
these articles are for my own private use, they are not
dutiable, whether new or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did not answer.</p>

<p>He took out more linen, which he put on the floor,
and spreading open a pair of unmentionables, he asked
again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you worn this? It looks quite new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>He then took out a pair of socks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you worn these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Have a sniff at
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He continued his examination, and was about to
throw my evening suit on the floor. I had up to now
been <i>almost</i> amused at the proceedings, but I felt my
good-humor was going, and the lion began to wag its
tail. I took the man by the arm, and looking at him
sternly, I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you put this carefully on the top of some
other clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me and complied.</p>

<p>By this time all the contents of my large trunk were
spread on the floor.</p>

<p>He got up on his feet and said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I looked everywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t. Do you know how
the famous Regent diamond, worn by the last kings
of France on their
crowns, was smuggled
into French territory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creature looked
at me with an air of
impudence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>

<p>I explained to him,
and added:</p>

<p>The lion, that lies dormant at the bottom of the
quietest man, was fairly roused in me, and on the least
provocation, I would have given this man a first-class
hiding.</p>

<p>He went away, wondering whether I had insulted
him or not, and left me in the van to repack my trunk
as best I could, an operation which, I understand, it
was his duty to perform himself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="tt">Chicago (First Visit)&mdash;The &ldquo;Neighborhood&rdquo;
of Chicago&mdash;The History of Chicago&mdash;Public
Servants&mdash;A Very Deaf Man.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Chicago</i>, <i>February</i> 17.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Oh!</span> a lecturing tour in America!</p>

<p>I am here on my way to St. Paul and Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Just before leaving New York, I saw in a comic
paper that Bismarck must really now be considered as
a great man, because, since his departure from office,
there had been no rumor of his having applied to
Major Pond to get up a lecturing tour for him in the
United States.</p>

<p>It was not news to me that there are plenty of
people in America who laugh at the European author&rsquo;s
trick of going to the American platform as soon as he
has made a little name for himself in his own country.
The laugh finds an echo in England, especially from
some journalists who have never been asked to go,
and from a few men who, having done one tour, think
it wise not to repeat the experience. For my part,
when I consider that Emerson, Holmes, Mark Twain,
have been lecturers, that Dickens, Thackeray, Matthew
Arnold, Sala, Stanley, Archdeacon Farrar, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
more, all have made their bow to American audiences,
I fail to discover anything very derogatory in the proceeding.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">A PIG SQUEALING.</td></tr></table>

<p>Besides, I feel bound to say that there is nothing in
a lecturing tour in America, even in a highly successful
one, that can excite
the envy of the
most jealous &ldquo;failure&rdquo;
in the world.
Such work is about
the hardest that a
man, used to the
comforts of this life,
can undertake. Actors,
at all events,
stop a week, sometimes
a fortnight, in
the cities they visit;
but a lecturer is on
the road every day, happy when he has not to start
at night.</p>

<p>No words can picture the monotony of journeys
through an immense continent, the sameness of which
strikes you as almost unbearable. Everything is made
on one pattern. All the towns are alike. To be in a
railroad car for ten or twelve hours day after day can
hardly be called luxury, or even comfort. To have
one&rsquo;s poor brain matter thus shaken in the cranium is
terrible, especially when the cranium is not quite full.
Constant traveling softens the brain, liquefies it, churns
it, evaporates it, and it runs out of you through all the
cracks of your head. I own that traveling is comfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
in America, even luxurious; but the best fare
becomes monotonous and unpalatable when the dose
is repeated every day.</p>

<p>To-morrow night I lecture in Minneapolis. The
next night I am in Detroit. Distance about seven
hundred miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I manage it?&rdquo; said I to my impresario, when
he showed me my route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certn&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;if you catch a train
after your lecture, I guess you will arrive in time for
your lecture in Detroit the next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These remarks, in America, are made without a
smile.</p>

<p>On arriving at Chicago this morning, I found awaiting
me at the Grand Pacific Hotel, a letter from my
impresario. Here is the purport of it:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I know you have with you a trunk and a small portmanteau. I
would advise you to leave your trunk at the Grand Pacific, and to
take with you only the portmanteau, while you are in the neighborhood
of Chicago. You will thus save trouble, expense, etc.</p></div>

<p>On looking at my route, I found that the &ldquo;neighborhood
of Chicago&rdquo; included St. Paul, Minneapolis, Milwaukee,
Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Indianapolis:
something like a little two-thousand-mile tour &ldquo;in the
neighborhood of Chicago,&rdquo; to be done in about one
week.</p>

<p>When I confided my troubles to my American
friends, I got little sympathy from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite right,&rdquo; they would say; &ldquo;we call the
neighborhood of a city any place which, by starting
after dinner, you can reach at about breakfast time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
next day. You dine, you go on board the car, you
have a smoke, you go to bed, you sleep, you wake up,
you dress&mdash;and there you are. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all you may be of this opinion, if you do not
reckon sleeping time. But I do reckon it, when I
have to spend the night in a closed box, six feet long,
and three feet wide, and about two feet high, and
especially when the operation has to be repeated three
or four times a week.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>And the long weary days that are not spent in
traveling, how can they be passed, even tolerably, in
an American city, where the lonely lecturer knows
nobody, and where there is absolutely nothing to be
seen beyond the hotels and the dry-goods stores?
Worse still: he sometimes has the good luck to make
the acquaintance of some charming people: but he has
hardly had time to fix their features in his memory,
when he has to go, probably never to see them again.</p>

<p>The lecturer speaks for an hour and a half on the
platform every evening, the rest of his time is exclusively
devoted to keeping silence. Poor fellow! how
grateful he is to the hotel clerk who sometimes&mdash;alas,
very seldom&mdash;will chat with him for a few minutes.
As a rule the hotel clerk is a mute, who assigns a room
to you, or hands you the letters waiting for you in the
box corresponding to your number. His mouth is
closed. He may have seen you for half a minute only;
he will remember you. Even in a hotel accommodating
over a thousand guests, he will know you, he will know
the number of your room, but he won&rsquo;t speak. He is
not the only American that won&rsquo;t speak. Every man
in America who is attending to some duty of other,
has his mouth closed. I have tried the railroad conductor,
and found him mute. I have had a shot at the
porter in the Pullman car, and found him mute. I
have endeavored to
draw out the janitors
of the halls where I
was to speak in the
evening, and I have
failed. Even the
negroes won&rsquo;t speak.
You would imagine
that speaking was
prohibited by the
statute-book. When
my lecture was over,
I returned to the
hotel, and like a culprit
crept to bed.

<p>How I do love
New York! It is
not that it possesses
a single building that I really care for; it is because
it contains scores and scores of delightful people,
brilliant, affable, hospitable, warm-hearted friends, who
were kind enough to welcome me when I returned
from a tour, and in whose company I could break up
the cobwebs that had had time to form in the corners
of my mouth.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The history of Chicago can be written in a few lines.
So can the history of the whole of America.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span> </p>

<p>In about 1830 a man called Benjamin Harris, with
his family, moved to Chicago, or Fort Dearborn, as it
was then called. Not more than half a dozen whites,
all of whom were Indian traders, had preceded them.
In 1832 they had a child, the first white female born
in Chicago&mdash;now married, called Mrs. S. A. Holmes,
and the mother of fourteen children. In 1871 Chicago
had over 100,000 inhabitants, and was burned to
the ground. To-day Chicago has over 1,200,000 inhabitants,
and in ten years&rsquo; time will have two millions.</p>

<p>The activity in Chicago is perfectly amazing. And
I don&rsquo;t mean commercial activity only. Compare
the following statistics: In the great reading rooms
of the British Museum, there was an average of 620
readers daily during the year 1888. In the reading-room
of the Chicago Public Library, there was an average
of 1569 each day in the same year. Considering
that the population of London is nearly five times that
of Chicago, it shows that the reading public is ten
times more numerous in Chicago than in London.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>It is a never failing source of amusement to watch
the ways of public servants in this country.</p>

<p>I went to pay a visit to a public museum this afternoon.</p>

<p>In Europe, the keepers, that is to say, the servants
of the public, have cautions posted in the museums, in
which &ldquo;the public are requested not to touch.&rdquo; In
France, they are &ldquo;begged,&rdquo; which is perhaps a more
suitable expression, as the museums, after all, belong
to the public.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span> </p>

<p>In America, the notice is &ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; This is
short and to the point. The servants of the public allow
you to enter the museums, charge you twenty-five
cents, and warn you to behave well. &ldquo;Hands off&rdquo;
struck me as rather off-handed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:352px; height:430px" src="images/img223.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE &ldquo;BRUSH-UP.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>I really admire the independence of all the servants
in this country. You may give them a tip, you will
not run the risk of making them servile or even
polite.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span> </p>

<p>The railway conductor says &ldquo;ticket!&rdquo; The word
<i>please</i> does not belong to his vocabulary any more than
the words &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;ticket&rdquo; and
frowns. You show it to him. He looks at it suspiciously,
and gives it back to you with a haughty air
that seems to say: &ldquo;I hope you will behave properly
while you are in my car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tip in America is not <i>de rigueur</i> as in Europe.
The cabman charges you so much, and expects nothing
more. He would lose his dignity by accepting a
tip (many run the risk). He will often ask you for more
than you owe him; but this is the act of a sharp
man of business, not the act of a servant. In doing so,
he does not derogate from his character.</p>

<p>The negro is the only servant who smiles in America,
the only one who is sometimes polite and attentive,
and the only one who speaks English with a pleasant
accent.</p>

<p>The negro porter in the sleeping cars has seldom
failed to thank me for the twenty-five or fifty cent
piece I always give him after he has brushed&mdash;or
rather, swept&mdash;my clothes with his little broom.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, as I was packing my valise for
a journey to St. Paul and Minneapolis to-night, the
porter brought in a card. The name was unknown
to me; but the porter having said that it was the
card of a gentleman who was most anxious to speak
to me, I said, &ldquo;Very well, bring him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman entered the room, saluted me,
shook hands, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I am not intruding.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I must ask you not to detain me
long, because I am off in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir, that some time ago you were engaged
in teaching the French language in one of the
great public schools of England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was, sir,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a son whom I wish to speak French
properly, and I have come to ask for your views
on the subject. In other words, will you be good
enough to tell me what are the best methods for
teaching this language? Only excuse me, I am
very deaf.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:418px; height:250px" src="images/img225.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LEFT.</p></div>

<p>He pulled out of his back pocket two yards of gutta-percha
tube, and, applying one end to his ear and
placing the other against my mouth, he said, &ldquo;Go
ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I shouted through the tube. &ldquo;Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
please shut your eyes; nothing is better for increasing
the power of hearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man shut his eyes and turned his head sideways,
so as to have the listening ear in front of me.
I took my valise and ran to the elevator as fast as I
could.</p>

<p>That man may still be waiting for aught I know and
care.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Before leaving the hotel, I made the acquaintance
of Mr. George Kennan, the Russian traveler. His
articles on Russia and Siberia, published in the <i>Century
Magazine</i>, attracted a great deal of public attention,
and people everywhere throng to hear him relate
his terrible experiences on the platform. He has two
hundred lectures to give this season. He struck me
as a most remarkable man&mdash;simple, unaffected in his
manner, with unflinching resolution written on his
face; a man in earnest, you can see. I am delighted
to find that I shall have the pleasure of meeting him
again in New York in the middle of April. He looks
tired. He, too, is lecturing in the &ldquo;neighborhood of
Chicago,&rdquo; and is off now to the night train for Cincinnati.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="tt">St. Paul and Minneapolis, the Sister Cities&mdash;Rivalries
and Jealousies between Large American
Cities&mdash;Minnehaha Falls&mdash;Wonderful
Interviewers&mdash;My Hat gets into Trouble
Again&mdash;Electricity in the Air&mdash;Forest Advertisements&mdash;Railway
Speed in America.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>St. Paul, Minn.</i>, <i>February</i> 20.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Arrived</span> at St. Paul the day before yesterday
to pay a professional visit to the two great sister
cities of the north of America.</p>

<p>Sister cities! Yes, they are near enough to shake
hands and kiss each other, but I am afraid they avail
themselves of their proximity to scratch each other&rsquo;s
faces.</p>

<p>If you open Bouillet&rsquo;s famous Dictionary of History
and Geography (edition 1880), you will find in it neither
St. Paul nor Minneapolis. I was told yesterday that
in 1834 there was one white inhabitant in Minneapolis.
To-day the two cities have about 200,000 inhabitants
each. Where is the dictionary of geography that
can keep pace with such wonderful phantasmagoric
growth? The two cities are separated by a distance
of about nine miles, but they are every day growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
up toward each other, and to-morrow they will practically
have become one.</p>

<p>Nothing is more amusing than the jealousies which
exist between the different large cities of the United
States, and when these rival places are close to each
other, the feeling of jealousy is so intensified as to
become highly entertaining.</p>

<p>St. Paul charges Minneapolis with copying into
the census names from tombstones, and it is affirmed
that young men living in either one of the cities
will marry girls belonging to the other so as to decrease
its population by one. The story goes
that once a preacher having announced, in a Minneapolis
church, that he had taken the text of his
sermon from St. Paul, the congregation walked out
<i>en masse</i>.</p>

<p>New York despises Philadelphia, and pokes fun at
Boston. On the other hand, Boston hates Chicago,
and <i>vice versa</i>. St. Louis has only contempt for Chicago,
and both cities laugh heartily at Detroit and
Milwaukee. San Francisco and Denver are left alone
in their prosperity. They are so far away from the
east and north of America, that the feeling they inspire
is only one of indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philadelphia is a city of homes, not of lodging-houses,&rdquo;
once said a Philadelphian to a New Yorker;
&ldquo;and it spreads over a far greater area than New York,
with less than half the inhabitants.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied
the New Yorker, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because it has been so much
sat upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a city of commerce,&rdquo; said a Bostonian to
a New York wit; &ldquo;Boston is a city of culture.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the New Yorker. &ldquo;You spell culture
with a big C, and God with a small g.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course St. Paul and Minneapolis accuse each
other of counting their respective citizens twice over.
All that is diverting in the highest degree. This feeling
does not exist only between the rival cities of the
New World, it exists in the Old. Ask a Glasgow man
what he thinks of Edinburgh, and an Edinburgh man
what he thinks of Glasgow!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>On account of the intense cold (nearly thirty degrees
below zero), I have not been able to see much either of
St. Paul or of Minneapolis, and I am unable to please
or vex either of these cities by pointing out their
beauties and defects. Both are large and substantially
built, with large churches, schools, banks, stores, and
all the temples that modern Christians erect to Jehovah
and Mammon. I may say that the Ryan Hotel at St.
Paul and the West House at Minneapolis are among
the very best hotels I have come across in America, the
latter especially. When I have added that, the day
before yesterday, I had an immense audience in the
People&rsquo;s Church at St. Paul, and that to-night I have
had a crowded house at the Grand Opera House in
Minneapolis, it is hardly necessary for me to say that I
shall have enjoyed myself in the two great towns, and
that I shall carry away with me a delightful recollection
of them.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Soon after arriving in Minneapolis yesterday, I went
to see the Minnehaha Falls, immortalized by Longfellow.
The motor line gave me an idea of rapid transit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
I returned to the West House for lunch and spent
the afternoon writing. Many interviewers called.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:312px; height:430px" src="images/img230.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;WHAT YEARLY INCOME DOES YOUR BOOKS
AND LECTURES BRING IN?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The first who came sat down in my room and point-blank
asked me my views on contagious diseases.
Seeing that I was not disposed to talk on the subject,
he asked me to discourse on republics and the prospects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
of General Boulanger. In fact, anything for
copy.</p>

<p>The second one, after asking me where I came from
and where I was going, inquired whether I had exhausted
the Anglo-Saxons and whether I should write
on other nations. After I had satisfied him, he asked me
what yearly income my books and lectures brought in.</p>

<p>Another wanted to know why I had not brought my
wife with me, how many children I had, how old they
were, and other details as wonderfully interesting to
the public. By and by I saw he was jotting down a
description of my appearance, and the different clothes
I had on! &ldquo;I will unpack this trunk,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
spread all its contents on the floor. Perhaps you would
be glad to have a look at my things.&rdquo; He smiled:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble any more,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am very much
obliged to you for your courtesy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This morning, on opening the papers, I see that my
hat is getting into trouble again. I thought that, after
getting rid of my brown hat and sending it to the editor
in the town where it had created such a sensation, peace
was secured. Not a bit. In the Minneapolis <i>Journal</i>
I read the following:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The attractive personality of the man [allow me to record this for
the sake of what follows], heightened by his négligé sack coat and
vest, with a background of yellowish plaid trowsers, occasional
glimpses of which were revealed from beneath the folds of a heavy
ulster, which swept the floor [I was sitting of course] and was
trimmed with fur collar and cuffs. And then that hat! On the
table, carelessly thrown amid a pile of correspondence, was his
nondescript headgear. One of those half-sombreros affected by the
wild Western cowboy when on dress parade, an impossible combination
of dark-blue and bottle-green.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
Fancy treating in this off-handed way a $7.50 soft
black felt hat bought of the best hatter in New York!
No, nothing is sacred for those interviewers. Dark-blue
and bottle-green! Why, did that man imagine that I
wore my hat inside out so as to show the silk lining?</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The air here is perfectly wonderful, dry and full of
electricity. If your fingers come into contact with
anything metallic, like the hot-water pipes, the chandeliers,
the stopper of your washing basin, they draw
a spark, sharp and vivid. One of the reporters who
called here, and to whom I mentioned the fact, was
able to light my gas with his finger, by merely obtaining
an electric spark on the top of the burner. When
he said he could thus light the gas, I thought he was
joking.</p>

<p>I had observed this phenomenon before. In Ottawa,
for instance.</p>

<p>Whether this air makes you live too quickly, I do
not know; but it is most bracing and healthy. I have
never felt so well and hearty in my life as in these cold,
dry climates.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I was all the more flattered to have such a large and
fashionable audience at the Grand Opera House to-night,
that my <i>causerie</i> was not given under the auspices
of any society, or as one of any course of lectures.</p>

<p>I lecture in Detroit the day after to-morrow. I shall
have to leave Minneapolis to-morrow morning at six
o&rsquo;clock for Chicago, which I shall reach at ten in the
evening. Then I shall have to run to the Michigan
Central Station to catch the night train to Detroit at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
eleven. Altogether, twenty-three hours of railway
traveling&mdash;745 miles.</p>

<p>And still in &ldquo;the neighborhood of Chicago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My lectures have never been criticised in more kind,
flattering, and eulogistic terms than in the St. Paul and
the Minneapolis papers, which I am reading on my
way to Chicago. I find
newspaper reading a
great source of amusement
in the trains.
First of all because
these papers always are
light reading, and also
because reading is a
possibility in a well
lighted carriage going
only at a moderate
speed. Eating is comfortable,
and even writing
is possible <i>en route</i>.
With the exception of
a few trains, such as are run from New York to Boston,
Chicago, and half a dozen other important cities, railway
traveling is slower in America than in England
and France; but I have never found fault with the
speed of an American train. On the contrary, I have
always felt grateful to the driver for running slowly.
And every time that the car reached the other side
of some of the many rotten wooden bridges on which
the train had to pass, I returned thanks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="tt">Detroit&mdash;The Town&mdash;The Detroit &ldquo;Free
Press&rdquo;&mdash;A Lady Interviewer&mdash;The &ldquo;Unco
Guid&rdquo; in Detroit&mdash;Reflections on the
Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;Unco Guid.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Detroit</i>, <i>February</i> 22.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Am</span> delighted with Detroit. It possesses beautiful
streets, avenues, and walks, and a fine square in the
middle of which stands a remarkably fine monument.
I am also grateful to this city for breaking the monotony
of the eternal parallelograms with which the
whole of the United States are built. My national
vanity almost suggests to me that this town owes its
gracefulness to its French origin. There are still, I
am told, about 25,000 French people settled in
Detroit.</p>

<p>I have had to-night, in the Church of Our Father,
a crowded and most brilliant audience, whose keenness,
intelligence, and kindness were very flattering.</p>

<p>I was interviewed, both by a lady and a gentleman,
for the Detroit <i>Free Press</i>, that most witty of American
newspapers. The charming young lady interviewer
came to talk on social topics, I remarked that
she was armed with a copy of &ldquo;Jonathan and his
Continent,&rdquo; and I came to the conclusion that she
would probably ask for a few explanations about that
book. I was not mistaken. She took exception, she
informed me, to many statements concerning the
American girl in the book. I made a point to prove
to her that all was right, and all was truth, and I think
I persuaded her to abandon the prosecution.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:467px; height:610px" src="images/img236.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LADY INTERVIEWER.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span></p>

<p>To tell the truth, now the real truth, mind you, I
am rather tired of hearing about the American girl.
The more I see of her the more I am getting convinced
that she is&mdash;like the other girls in the world.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>A friend, who came to have a chat with me after this
lecture, has told me that the influential people of the
city are signing a petition to the custodians of the
museum calling upon them to drape all the nude
statues, and intimating their intention of boycotting
the institution, if the Venuses and Apollos are not
forthwith provided with tuckers and togas.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact in the history of the world,
that young communities have no taste for fine art&mdash;they
have no time to cultivate it. If I had gone to
Oklahoma, I should not have expected to find any art
feeling at all; but that in a city like Detroit, where
there is such evidence of intellectual life and high
culture among the inhabitants, a party should be
found numerous and strong enough to issue such a
heathen dictate as this seems scarcely credible. I am
inclined to think it must be a joke. That the &ldquo;unco
guid&rdquo; should flourish under the gloomy sky of Great
Britain I understand, but under the bright blue sky of
America, in that bracing atmosphere, I cannot.</p>

<p>It is most curious that there should be people who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
when confronted with some glorious masterpiece of
sculpture, should not see the poetry, the beauty of the
human form divine. This is beyond me, and beyond
any educated Frenchman.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:357px; height:430px" src="images/img238.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DRAPED STATUES.</p></div>

<p>Does the &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; exist in America, then? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
should have thought that these people, of the earth
earthy, were not found out of England and Scotland.</p>

<p>When I was in America two years ago, I heard that
an English author of some repute, talking one day
with Mr. Richard Watson Gilder about the Venus of
Milo, had remarked that, as he looked at her beautiful
form, he longed to put his arms around her and kiss
her. Mr. Gilder, who, as a poet, as an artist, has felt
only respect mingled with his admiration of the matchless
divinity, replied: &ldquo;I hope she would have grown
a pair of arms for the occasion, so as to have slapped
your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not so much the thing that offends the &ldquo;unco
guid&rdquo;; it is the name, the reflection, the idea. Unhealthy-minded
himself, he dreads a taint where there
is none, and imagines in others a corruption which
exists only in himself.</p>

<p>Yet the One, whom he would fain call Master, but
whose teachings he is slow in following, said: &ldquo;Woe be
to them by whom offense cometh.&rdquo; But the &ldquo;unco
guid&rdquo; is a Christian failure, a <i>parvenu</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The <i>parvenu</i> is a person who makes strenuous efforts
to persuade other people that he is entitled to the
position he occupies.</p>

<p>There are <i>parvenus</i> in religion, as there are <i>parvenus</i>
in the aristocracy, in society, in literature, in the fine
arts, etc.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE PARVENU.</td></tr></table>

<p>The worst type of the French <i>parvenu</i> is the one
whose father was a worthy, hard-working man called
<i>Dubois</i> or <i>Dumont</i>, and who, at his father&rsquo;s death, dubs
himself <i>du Bois</i> or <i>du Mont</i>, becomes a clericalist and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
the stanchest monarchist,
and runs down
the great Revolution
which made one of his
grand-parents a man.
M. <i>du Bois</i> or <i>du Mont</i>
outdoes the genuine
nobleman, who needs
make no noise to attract
attention to a
name which everybody
knows, and which, in
spite of what may be
said on the subject,
often recalls the memory
of some glorious
event in the past.</p>

<p>The worst type of
Anglo-Saxon <i>parvenu</i>
is probably the &ldquo;unco
guid,&rdquo; or religious <i>parvenu</i>.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon
&ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; is seldom
to be found among
Roman Catholics; that
is, among the followers
of the most ancient
Christian religion. He
is to be found among
the followers of the newest forms of &ldquo;Christianity.&rdquo;
This is quite natural. He has to try to eclipse his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
fellow-Christians by his piety, in order to show that
the new religion to which he belongs was a necessary
invention.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; is easily recognized.
He is dark (all bigots and fanatics are). He is dressed
in black, shiny broadcloth raiment. A wide-brimmed
felt hat covers his head. He walks with light, short,
jaunty steps, his head a little inclined on one side.
He never carries a stick, which might give a rather
fast appearance to his turn-out. He invariably carries
an umbrella, even in the brightest weather, as being
more respectable&mdash;and this umbrella he never rolls, for
he would avoid looking in the distance as if he had a
stick. He casts right and left little grimaces that are
so many forced smiles of self-satisfaction. &ldquo;Try to be
as good as I am,&rdquo; he seems to say to all who happen
to look at him, &ldquo;and you will be as happy.&rdquo; And he
&ldquo;smiles, and smiles, and smiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He has a small soul, a small heart, and a small brain.</p>

<p>As a rule, he is a well-to-do person. It pays better
to have a narrow mind than to have broad sympathies.</p>

<p>He drinks tea, but prefers cocoa, as being a more
virtuous beverage.</p>

<p>He is perfectly destitute of humor, and is the most
inartistic creature in the world. Everything suggests
to him either profanity or indecency. The &ldquo;Reminiscences
of Scottish Life and Character,&rdquo; by Dean
Ramsay, would strike him as profane, and if placed in
the Musée du Louvre, before the Venus of Milo, he
would see nothing but a woman who has next to no
clothes on.</p>

<p>His distorted mind makes him take everything in ill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
part. His hands get pricked on every thorn that he
comes across on the road, and he misses all the roses.</p>

<p>If I were not a Christian, the following story, which
is not as often told as it should be, would have converted
me long ago:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Jesus arrived one evening at the gates of a certain city, and he
sent his disciples forward to prepare supper, while he himself, intent
on doing good, walked through the streets into the marketplace.
And he saw at the corner of the market some people gathered
together, looking at an object on the ground; and he drew
near to see what it might be. It was a dead dog, with a halter
round his neck, by which he appeared to have been dragged
through the dirt; and a viler, a more abject, a more unclean thing,
never met the eyes of man. And those who stood by looked on
with abhorrence. &ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; said one, stopping his nose, &ldquo;it
pollutes the air.&rdquo; &ldquo;How long,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;shall this foul
beast offend our sight?&rdquo; &ldquo;Look at his torn hide,&rdquo; said a third;
&ldquo;one could not even cut a shoe out of it!&rdquo; &ldquo;And his ears,&rdquo; said
a fourth, &ldquo;all draggled and bleeding!&rdquo; &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said a fifth,
&ldquo;he has been hanged for thieving!&rdquo; And Jesus heard them, and
looking down compassionately on the dead creature, he said:
&ldquo;Pearls are not equal to the whiteness of his teeth!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>If I understand the Gospel, the gist of its teachings
is contained in the foregoing little story. Love and
forgiveness: finding something to pity and admire
even in a dead dog. Such is the religion of Christ.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Christianity&rdquo; of the &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; is as like
this religion as are the teachings of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Something to condemn, the discovery of wickedness
in the most innocent, and often elevating, recreations,
such is the favorite occupation of the Anglo-Saxon
&ldquo;unco guid.&rdquo; Music is licentious, laughter wicked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
dancing immoral, statuary almost criminal, and, by
and by, the &ldquo;Society for the Suggestion of Indecency,&rdquo;
which is placed under his immediate patronage
and supervision, will find fault with our going out
in the streets, on the plea that under our garments we
carry our nudity.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; is the successor of
the Pharisee. In reading Christ&rsquo;s description of the
latter, you are immediately struck with the likeness.
The modern &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; &ldquo;loves to pray standing in
the churches and chapels and in the corners of the
streets, that he may be seen of men.&rdquo; &ldquo;He uses vain
repetitions, for he thinks that he shall be heard for his
much speaking.&rdquo; &ldquo;When he fasts, he is of sad countenance;
for he disfigures his face, that he may appear
unto men to fast.&rdquo; There is not one feature of the
portrait that does not fit in exactly.</p>

<p>The Jewish &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; crucified Christ. The
Anglo-Saxon one would crucify Him again if He should
return to earth and interfere with the prosperous business
firms that make use of His name.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;unco guid&rsquo;s&rdquo; Christianity consists in extolling
his virtues and ignoring other people&rsquo;s. He spends
his time in &ldquo;pulling motes out of people&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; but
cannot see clearly to do it, &ldquo;owing to the beams that
are in his own.&rdquo; He overwhelms you, he crushes you,
with his virtue, and one of the greatest treats is to
catch him tripping, a chance which you may occasionally
have, especially when you meet him on the Continent
of Europe.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; calls himself a
Christian, but the precepts of the Gospel are the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
opposite of those he practices. The gentle, merciful,
forgiving, Man-God of the Gospel has not for him the
charms and attractions of the Jehovah who commanded
the cowardly, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty people of
his choice to treat their women as slaves, and to exterminate
their enemies, sparing neither old men,
women, nor children. This cruel, revengeful, implacable
deity is far more to the Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;unco
guid&rsquo;s&rdquo; liking than the Saviour who bade His disciples
love their enemies and put up their swords in the
presence of his persecutors. The &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; is not
a Christian, he is a Jew in all but name. And I will
say this much for him, that the Commandments given
on Mount Sinai are much easier to follow than the
Sermon on the Mount. It is easier not to commit
murder than to hold out your right cheek after your
left one has been slapped. It is easier not to steal
than to run after the man who has robbed us, in order
to offer him what he has not taken. It is easier to
honor our parents than to love our enemies.</p>

<p>The teachings of the Gospel are trying to human
nature. There is no religion more difficult to follow;
and this is why, in spite of its beautiful, but too lofty,
precepts, there is no religion in the world that can
boast so many hypocrites&mdash;so many followers who
pretend that they follow their religion, but who do
not, and very probably cannot.</p>

<p>Being unable to love man, as he is bidden in the
Gospel, the &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; loves God, as he is bidden
in the Old Testament. He loves God in the abstract.
He tells Him so in endless prayers and litanies.</p>

<p>For him Christianity consists in discussing theological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
questions, whether a minister shall preach with or
without a white surplice on, and in singing hymns
more or less out of tune.</p>

<p>As if God could be loved to the exclusion of man!
You love God, after all, as you love anybody else, not
by professions of love, but by deeds.</p>

<p>When he prays, the &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; buries his face in
his hands or in his hat. He screws up his face, and the
more fervent the prayer is (or the more people are
looking at him), the more grimaces he makes. Heinrich
Heine, on coming out of an English church, said
that &ldquo;a blaspheming Frenchman must be a more
pleasing object in the sight of God than many a praying
Englishman.&rdquo; He had, no doubt, been looking at
the &ldquo;unco guid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you do not hold the same religious views as he
does, you are a wicked man, an atheist. He alone has
the truth. Being engaged in a discussion with an
&ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; one day, I told him that if God had
given me hands to handle, surely He had given me a
little brain to think. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he quickly
interrupted; &ldquo;but, with the hands that God gave you
you can commit a good action, and you can also commit
murder.&rdquo; Therefore, because I did not think as
he did, I was the criminal, for, of course, he was the
righteous man. For all those who, like myself, believe
in a future life, there is, I believe, a great treat in store:
the sight of the face he will make, when his place is
assigned to him in the next world. <i>Qui mourra, verra.</i></p>

<p>Anglo-Saxon land is governed by the &ldquo;unco guid.&rdquo;
Good society cordially despises him; the aristocracy
of Anglo-Saxon intelligence&mdash;philosophers, scientists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
men of letters, artists&mdash;simply loathe him; but all have
to bow to his rule, and submit their works to his
most incompetent criticism, and all are afraid of him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:371px; height:430px" src="images/img246.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE POOR MAN&rsquo;S SABBATH.</p></div>

<p>In a moment of wounded national pride, Sydney
Smith once exclaimed: &ldquo;What a pity it is we have
no amusements in England except vice and religion!&rdquo;
The same exclamation might be uttered to-day, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
cause laid at the Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;unco guid&rsquo;s&rdquo; door. It
is he who is responsible for the degradation of the British
lower classes, by refusing to enable them to elevate
their minds on Sundays at the sight of the masterpieces
of art which are contained in the museums, or
at the sound of the symphonies of Beethoven and
Mozart, which might be given to the people at reduced
prices on that day. The poor people must choose
between vice and religion, and as the wretches know
they are not wanted in the churches, they go to the
taverns.</p>

<p>It is this same &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; who is responsible for
the state of the streets in the large cities of Great
Britain by refusing to allow vice to be regulated. If you
were to add the amount of immorality to be found in
the streets of Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and the other capitals
of Europe, no fair-minded Englishman &ldquo;who knows&rdquo;
would contradict me, if I said that the total thus obtained
would be much below the amount supplied by
London alone; but the &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; stays at home of
an evening, advises you to do the same, and ignoring,
or pretending to ignore, what is going on round his
own house, he prays for the conversion&mdash;of the French.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; thinks that his own future safety
is assured, so he prays for his neighbors&rsquo;. He reminds
one of certain Scots, who inhabit two small islands on
the west coast of Scotland. Their piety is really most
touching. Every Sunday in their churches, they commend
to God&rsquo;s care &ldquo;the puir inhabitants of the two
adjacent islands of Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, there appeared in a Liverpool paper
a letter, signed &ldquo;A Lover of Reverence,&rdquo; in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
this anonymous person complained of a certain lecturer,
who had indulged in profane remarks. &ldquo;I was
not present myself,&rdquo; he or she said, &ldquo;but have heard of
what took place,&rdquo; etc. You see, this person was not
present, but as a good &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; he hastened to
judge. However, this is nothing. In the letter, I
read: &ldquo;Fortunately, there are in Liverpool, a few
Christians, like myself, always on the watch, and
ever looking after our Maker&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunate Liverpool! What a proud position for
the Almighty, to be placed in Liverpool under the
protection of the &ldquo;Lover of Reverence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably this &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; and myself would not agree
on the definition of the word <i>profanity</i>, for, if I had
written and published such a letter, I would consider
myself guilty, not only of profanity, but of blasphemy.</p>

<p>If the &ldquo;unco guid&rdquo; is the best product of Christianity,
Christianity must be pronounced a ghastly failure,
and I should feel inclined to exclaim, with the late
Dean Milman, &ldquo;If all this is Christianity, it is high
time we should try something else&mdash;say the religion
of Christ, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="tt">Milwaukee&mdash;A Well-filled Day&mdash;Reflections
on the Scotch in America&mdash;Chicago Criticisms.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Milwaukee</i>, <i>February</i> 25.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Arrived</span> here from Detroit yesterday. Milwaukee
is a city of over two hundred thousand
inhabitants, a very large proportion of whom are Germans,
who have come here to settle down, and wish
good luck to the <i>Vaterland</i>, at the respectful distance
of five thousand miles.</p>

<p>At the station I was met by Mr. John L. Mitchell,
the railway king, and by a compatriot of mine, M. A.
de Guerville, a young enthusiast who has made up his
mind to check the German invasion of Milwaukee, and
has succeeded in starting a French society, composed
of the leading inhabitants of the city. On arriving, I
found a heavy but delightful programme to go through
during the day: a lunch to be given me by the ladies
at Milwaukee College at one o&rsquo;clock; a reception by
the French Club at Mrs. John L. Mitchell&rsquo;s house at
four; a dinner at six; my lecture at eight, and a reception
and a supper by the Press Club at half-past ten; the
rest of the evening to be spent as circumstances would
allow or suggest. I was to be the guest of Mr. Mitchell
at his magnificent house in town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:489px; height:610px" src="images/img250.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A CITIZEN OF MILWAUKEE.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let us begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Went through the whole programme. The reception
by the French Club, in the beautiful Moorish-looking
rooms of Mrs. John L. Mitchell&rsquo;s superb mansion,
was a great success. I was amazed to meet so
many French-speaking people, and much amused to
see my young compatriot go from one group to another,
to satisfy himself that all the members of the
club were speaking French; for I must tell you that,
among the statutes of the club, there is one that imposes
a fine of ten cents on any member caught in
the act of speaking English at the gatherings of the
association.</p>

<p>The lecture was a great success. The New Plymouth
Church<a name="FnAnchor_3" id="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> was packed, and the audience extremely
warm and appreciative. The supper offered to me by
the Press Club proved most enjoyable. And yet, that
was not all. At one o&rsquo;clock the Press Club repaired
to a perfect German <i>Brauerei</i>, where we spent an hour
in Bavaria, drinking excellent Bavarian beer while
chatting, telling stories, etc.</p>

<p>I will omit to mention at what time we returned
home, so as not to tell tales about my kind host.</p>

<p>In spite of the late hours we kept last night, breakfast
was punctually served at eight this morning.
First course, porridge. Thanks to the kind, thoroughly
Scotch hospitality of Mr. John L. Mitchell and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
charming family, thanks to the many friends and
sympathizers I met here, I shall carry away a most
pleasant recollection of this large and beautiful city.
I shall leave Milwaukee with much regret. Indeed,
the worst feature of a thick lecturing tour is to feel,
almost every day, that you leave behind friends whom
you may never see again.</p>

<p>I lecture at the Central Music Hall, Chicago, this
evening; but Chicago is reached from here in two
hours and a half, and I will go as late in the day as I
can.</p>

<p>No more beds for me now, until I reach Albany, in
three days.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The railway king in Wisconsin is a Scotchman.
I was not surprised to hear it. The iron king in Pennsylvania
is a Scotchman, Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The
oil king of Ohio is a Scotchman, Mr. Alexander Macdonald.
The silver king of California is a Scotchman,
Mr. Mackay. The dry-goods-store king of New York&mdash;he
is dead now&mdash;was a Scotchman, Mr. Stewart.
It is just the same in Canada, just the same in Australia,
and all over the English-speaking world. The
Scotch are successful everywhere, and the new countries
offer them fields for their industry, their perseverance,
and their shrewdness. There you see them
landowners, directors of companies, at the head of all
the great enterprises. In the lower stations of life,
thanks to their frugality and saving habits, you find
them thriving everywhere. You go to the manufactory,
you are told that the foremen are Scotch.</p>

<p>I have, perhaps, a better illustration still.

<p class="caption">TALES OF OLD SCOTLAND.</p></div>

<p>If you travel in Canada, either by the Grand Trunk
or the Canadian Pacific, you will meet in the last parlor
car, near the stove, a man whose duty consists in seeing
that, all along the line, the workmen are at their
posts, digging, repairing, etc. These workmen are all
day exposed to the Canadian temperature, and often
have to work knee-deep in the snow. Well, you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
find that the man with small, keen eyes, who is able to
do his work in the railroad car, warming himself comfortably
by the stove, is invariably a Scotchman. There
is only one berth with a stove in the whole business;
it is he who has got it. Many times I have had a
chat with that Scotchman on the subject of old Scotland.
Many times I have sat with him in the little
smoking-room of the parlor car, listening to the history
of his life, or, maybe, a few good Scotch anecdotes.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>In the train from Chicago to Cleveland</i>, <i>February</i> 26.</p>

<p>I arrived in Chicago at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon
yesterday, dined, dressed, and lectured at the Music
Hall under the auspices of the Drexel free Kindergarten.
There was a large audience, and all passed
off very well. After the lecture, I went to the Grand
Pacific Hotel, changed clothes, and went on board the
sleeping car bound for Cleveland, O.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The criticisms of my lecture in this morning&rsquo;s Chicago
papers are lively.</p>

<p>The <i>Herald</i> calls me:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>A dapper little Frenchman. Five feet eleven in height, and two
hundred pounds in weight!</p></div>

<p>The <i>Times</i> says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>That splendid trinity of the American peerage, the colonel, the
judge, and the professor, turned out in full force at Central Music
Hall last night. The lecturer is a magician who serves up your
many little defects, peculiar to the auditors&rsquo; own country, on a
silver salver, so artistically garnished that one forgets the sarcasm
in admiration of the sauce.</p></div>

dust.</p></div>

<p>And after a good breakfast at Toledo station, I enjoyed
an hour poring over the Chicago papers.</p>

<p>I lecture in Cleveland to-night, and am still in &ldquo;the

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="tt1">The Monotony of Traveling in the States&mdash;&ldquo;Manon
Lescaut&rdquo; in America.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>In the train from Cleveland to Albany</i>, <i>February</i> 27.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Am</span> getting tired and ill. I am not bed-ridden,
but am fairly well rid of a bed. I have lately
spent as many nights in railway cars as in hotel beds.</p>

<p>Am on my way to Albany, just outside &ldquo;the neighborhood
of Chicago.&rdquo; I lecture in that place to-night,
and shall get to New York to-morrow.</p>

<p>I am suffering from the monotony of life. My
greatest objection to America (indeed I do not believe
I have any other) is the sameness of everything. I
understand the Americans who run away to Europe
every year to see an old church, a wall covered with
moss and ivy, some good old-fashioned peasantry not
dressed like the rest of the world.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;THE SAME &lsquo;INDIAN.&rsquo;&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>What strikes a European most, in his rambles
through America, is the absence of the picturesque.
The country is monotonous, and eternally the same.
Burned-up fields, stumps of trees, forests, wooden
houses all built on the same pattern. All the stations
you pass are alike. All the towns are alike. To say
that an American town is ten times larger than another
simply means that it has ten times more blocks of houses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
All the streets are alike, with the same telegraph poles,
the same &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; as a sign for tobacconists, the same
red, white, and blue pole as a sign for barbers. All the
hotels are the same,
all the <i>menus</i> are the
same, all the plates
and dishes the same&mdash;why,
all the ink-stands
are the same.
All the people are
dressed in the same
way. When you
meet an American
with all his beard,
you want to shake
his hands and thank
him for not shaving
it, as ninety-nine out
of every hundred
Americans do. Of
course I have not
seen California, the
Rocky Mountains,
and many other parts
of America where the
scenery is very beautiful; but I think my remarks can
apply to those States most likely to be visited by a
lecturer, that is, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and others, during the winter
months, after the Indian summer, and before the renewal
of verdure in May.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span> </p>

<p>After breakfast, that indefatigable man of business,
that intolerable bore, who incessantly bangs the doors
and brings his stock-in-trade to the cars, came and
whispered in my ears:</p>

<p>&ldquo;New book&mdash;just out&mdash;a forbidden book!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A forbidden book! What is that?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>He showed it to me. It was &ldquo;Manon Lescaut.&rdquo;</p>

<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;NEW BOOK JUST OUT&mdash;A FORBIDDEN
BOOK!&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>Is it possible? That literary and artistic <i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>,
which has been the original type of &ldquo;Paul et
Virginie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Atala&rdquo;;
that touching drama,
which the prince of critics,
Jules Janin, declared
would be sufficient to save
contemporary literature
from complete oblivion,
dragged in the mire,
clothed in a dirty coarse
English garb! and advertised
as a forbidden
book! Three generations
of French people have
wept over the pathetic
story. Here it is now,
stripped of its unique
style and literary beauty, sold to the American
public as an improper book&mdash;a libel by translation
on a genius. British authors have complained for
years that their books were stolen in America. They
have suffered in pockets, it is true, but their reputation
has spread through an immense continent. What is
their complaint compared to that of the French authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
who have the misfortune to see their works
translated into American? It is not only their pockets
that suffer, but their reputation. The poor French
author is at the mercy of incapable and malicious
translators hired at starvation wages by the American
pirate publisher. He is liable to a species of defamation
ten times worse than robbery.</p>

<p>And as I looked at that copy of &ldquo;Manon Lescaut,&rdquo;
I almost felt grateful that Prevost was dead.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="tt">For the First Time I See an American Paper
Abuse Me&mdash;Albany to New York&mdash;A Lecture
at Daly&rsquo;s Theater&mdash;Afternoon Audiences.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>February</i> 23.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">The</span> American press has always been very good to
me. Fairness one has a right to expect, but kindness
is an extra that is not always thrown in, and
therefore the uniform amiability of the American press
toward me could not fail to strike me most agreeably.</p>

<p>Up to yesterday I had not seen a single unkind
notice or article, but in the Albany <i>Express</i> of yesterday
morning I read:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>This evening the people of Albany are asked to listen to a lecture
by Max O&rsquo;Rell, who was in this country two years ago, and was
treated with distinguished courtesy. When he went home he
published a book filled with deliberate misstatements and willful
exaggerations of the traits of the American people.</p></div>

<p>This paper &ldquo;has reason,&rdquo; as the French say. My
book contained one misstatement, at all events, and
that was that &ldquo;all Americans have a great sense of
humor.&rdquo; You may say that the French are a witty
people, but that does not mean that France contains
no fools. It is rather painful to have to explain such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
things, but I do so for the benefit of that editor and
with apologies to the general reader.</p>

<p>In spite of this diverting little &ldquo;par,&rdquo; I had an immense
audience last night in Harmanus Bleecker
Hall, a new and magnificent construction in Albany,
excellent, no doubt, for music, but hardly adapted
for lecturing in, on account of its long and narrow
shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:292px; height:320px" src="images/img262.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RIP VAN WINKLE.</p></div>

<p>I should have liked to stay longer in Albany, which
struck me as being a remarkably beautiful place, but
having to lecture in New York this afternoon, I took
the vestibule train early this morning for New York.
This journey is exceedingly picturesque along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
Hudson River, traveling as you do between two
ranges of wooded hills, dotted over with beautiful
habitations, and now and then passing a little town
bathing its feet in the water. In the distance one gets
good views of the Catskill Mountains, immortalized by
Washington Irving in &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On boarding the train, the first thing I did was to
read the news of yesterday. Imagine my amusement,
on opening the Albany <i>Express</i> to read the following
extract from the report of my lecture:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>He has an agreeable but not a strong voice. This was the only
point that could be criticised in his lecture, which consisted of
many clever sketches of the humorous side of the character of
different Anglo-Saxon nations. His humor is keen. He evidently
is a great admirer of America and Americans, only bringing into
ridicule some of their most conspicuously objectionable traits....
His lecture was entertaining, clever, witty and thoroughly enjoyable.</p></div>

<p>The most amusing part of all this is that the American
sketches which I introduced into my lecture last
night, and which seemed to have struck the Albany
<i>Express</i> so agreeably, were all extracts from the book
&ldquo;filled with deliberate misstatements and willful exaggerations
of the traits of the American people.&rdquo;
Well, after all, there is humor, unconscious humor, in
the Albany <i>Express</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Arrived at the Grand Central Station in New York
at noon, I gave up my check to a transfer man, but
learned to my chagrin that the vestibule train from
Albany had carried no baggage, and that my things
would only arrive by the next train at about three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
o&rsquo;clock. Pleasant news for a man who was due to
address an audience at three!</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 210px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:156px; height:320px" src="images/img264.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;A LITTLE BIT STIFF.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>There was only one way out of the difficulty. Off
I went post-haste to a ready-made tailor&rsquo;s, who sold
me a complete fit-out from head
to foot. I did not examine the
cut and fit of each garment very
minutely, but went off satisfied
that I was presenting a neat and
respectable appearance. Before
going on the stage, however, I
discovered that the sleeves of the
new coat, though perfectly smooth
and well-behaved so long as the
arms inside them were bent at the
elbow, developed a remarkable
cross-twist as soon as I let my
arms hang straight down.</p>

<p>By means of holding it firm
with the middle finger, I managed
to keep the recalcitrant sleeve in
position, and the affair passed off
very well. Only my friends remarked, after the lecture,
that they thought I looked a little bit stiff,
especially when making my bow to the audience.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>My lecture at Daly&rsquo;s Theater this afternoon was
given under the auspices of the Bethlehem Day Nursery,
and I am thankful to think that this most interesting
association is a little richer to-day than it was
yesterday. For an afternoon audience it was remarkably
warm and responsive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span> </p>

<p>I have many times lectured to afternoon audiences,
but have not, as a rule, enjoyed it. Afternoon &ldquo;shows&rdquo;
are a mistake. Do not ask me why; but think of
those you have ever been to, and see if you have a
lively recollection of them. There is a time for everything.
Fancy playing the guitar under your lady love&rsquo;s
window by daylight, for instance!</p>

<p>Afternoon audiences are kid-gloved ones. There is
but a sprinkling of men, and so the applause, when it
comes, is a feeble affair, more chilling almost than
silence. In some fashionable towns it is bad form to
applaud at all in the afternoon. I have a vivid recollection
of the effect produced one afternoon in Cheltenham
by the vigorous applause of a sympathizing
friend of mine, sitting in the reserved seats. How all
the other reserved seats craned their necks in credulous
astonishment to get a view of this innovator, this outer
barbarian! He was new to the wondrous ways of the
<i>Chillitonians</i>. In the same audience was a lady, Irish
and very charming, as I found out on later acquaintance,
who showed her appreciation from time to time
by clapping the tips of her fingers together noiselessly,
while her glance said: &ldquo;I should very much like to
applaud, but you know I can&rsquo;t do it; we are in Cheltenham,
and such a thing is bad form, especially in the
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:419px; height:430px" src="images/img266.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE GOUTY MAN.</p></div>

<p>Afternoon audiences in the southern health resorts
of England are probably the least inspiriting and inspiring
of all. There are the sick, the lame, the halt.
Some of them are very interesting people, but a large
proportion appear to be suffering more from the boredom
of life than any other complaint, and look as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
it would do them good to follow out the well-known
advice, &ldquo;Live on sixpence a day, and earn it.&rdquo; It is
hard work entertaining people who have done everything,
seen everything, tasted everything, been everywhere&mdash;people
whose sole aim is to kill time. A fair
sprinkling are gouty. They spend most of their waking
hours in a bath-chair. As a listener, the gouty
man is sometimes decidedly funny. He gives signs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
life from time to time by a vigorous slap on his thigh
and a vicious looking kick. Before I began to know
him, I used to wonder whether it was my discourse
producing some effect upon him.</p>

<p>I am not afraid of meeting these people in America.
Few people are bored here, all are happy to live, and
all work and are busy. American men die of brain
fever, but seldom of the gout. If an American saw
that he must spend his life wheeled in a bath-chair, he
would reflect that rivers are numerous in America, and
he would go and take a plunge into one of them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="tt1">Wanderings through New York&mdash;Lecture at
the Harmonie Club&mdash;Visit to the Century
Club.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>March</i> 1.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">The</span> more I see New York, the more I like
it.</p>

<p>After lunch I had a drive through Central Park and
Riverside Park, along the Hudson, and thoroughly
enjoyed it. I returned to the Everett House through
Fifth Avenue. I have never seen Central Park in
summer, but I can realize how beautiful it must be
when the trees are clothed. To have such a park in
the heart of the city is perfectly marvelous. It is
true that, with the exception of the superb Catholic
Cathedral, Fifth Avenue has no monument worth
mentioning, but the succession of stately mansions is
a pleasant picture to the eye. What a pity this
cathedral cannot stand in a square in front of some
long thoroughfare, it would have a splendid effect. I
know this was out of the question. Built as New
York is, the cathedral could only take the place of a
block. It simply represents so many numbers between
Fiftieth and Fifty-first streets on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>In the Park I saw statues of Shakespeare, Walter
Scott, and Robert Burns. I should have liked to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
those of Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and many
other celebrities of the land. Washington, Franklin,
and Lincoln are practically the only Americans whose
statues you see all over the country. They play here
the part that Wellington and Nelson play in England.
After all, the &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; and the local politicians who
run the towns probably never heard of Longfellow,
Bryant, Poe, etc.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>At four o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Thomas Nast, the celebrated
caricaturist, called. I was delighted to make his
acquaintance, and found him a most charming man.</p>

<p>I dined with General Horace Porter and a few other
friends at the Union League Club. The witty general
was in his best vein.</p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock I lectured at the Harmonie Club,
and had a large and most appreciative audience, composed
of the pick of the Israelite community in New
York.</p>

<p>After the lecture I attended one of the &ldquo;Saturdays&rdquo;
at the Century Club, and met Mr. Kendal, who, with
his talented wife, is having a triumphant progress
through the United States.</p>

<p>There is no gathering in the world where you can
see so many beautiful, intelligent faces as at the Century
Club. There you see gathered together the
cleverest men of a nation whose chief characteristic
is cleverness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="tt1">Visit to the Brooklyn Academy of Music&mdash;Rev.
Dr. Talmage.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>March</i> 2.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Went</span> to hear Dr. T. de Witt Talmage this morning
at the Academy of Music, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>What an actor America has lost by Dr. Talmage
choosing the pulpit in preference to the stage!</p>

<p>The Academy of Music was crowded. Standing-room
only. For an old-fashioned European, to see a
theater, with its boxes, stalls, galleries, open for divine
service was a strange sight; but we had not gone very
far into the service before it became plain to me that
there was nothing divine about it. The crowd had
come there, not to worship God, but to hear Mr. Talmage.</p>

<p>At the door the programme was distributed. It consisted
of six hymns to be interluded with prayers by
the doctor. Between the fifth and sixth, he delivered
the lecture, or the sermon, if you insist on the name,
and during the sixth there was the collection, that
hinge on which the whole service turns in Protestant
places of worship.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 240px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:192px; height:320px" src="images/img271.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">THE LEADER OF THE CHOIR.</td></tr></table>

<p>I took a seat and awaited with the rest the entrance
of Dr. Talmage. There was subdued conversation going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
on all around, just as there would be at a theater
or concert: in fact, throughout the whole of the proceedings,
there was no sign of a silent lifting up of the
spirit in worship.
Not a person in that
strange congregation,
went on his or her
knees to pray. Most
of them put one hand
in front of the face,
and this was as near
as they got that morning
to an attitude of
devotion. Except for
this, and the fact that
they did not applaud,
there was absolutely
no difference between
them and any other
theater audience I
ever saw.</p>

<p>The monotonous
hymns were accompanied
by a <i>cornet-à-piston</i>,
which lent a
certain amount of life to them, but very little
religious harmony. That cornet was the key-note
of the whole performance. The hymns, composed,
I believe, for Dr. Talmage&rsquo;s flock, are not of
high literary value. &ldquo;General&rdquo; Booth would
probably hesitate to include such in the <i>répertoire</i>
of the Salvation Army. Judge of them for yourself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
Here are three illustrations culled from the
programme:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Sing, O sing, ye heirs of glory!</p>
<p>Shout your triumphs as you go:</p>
<p>Zion&rsquo;s gates will open for you,</p>
<p>You shall find an entrance through.</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p>Though the pathway be lonely, and dangerous too, (<i>sic</i>)</p>
<p>Surely Jesus is able to carry me thro&rsquo;.</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>This is poetry such as you find inside Christmas
crackers.</p>

<p>Another hymn began:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p>One more day&rsquo;s work for Jesus,</p>
<p>One less of life for me!</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I could not help thinking that there would be good
employment for a prophet of God, with a stout whip,
in the congregations of the so-called faithful of to-day.
I have heard them by hundreds shouting at the top of
their voices:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>O Paradise, O Paradise!</p>
  <p class="i1">&rsquo;Tis weary waiting here;</p>
<p>I long to be where Jesus is,</p>
  <p class="i1">To feel, to see him near.</p>
<p>O Paradise, O Paradise!</p>
  <p class="i1">I greatly long to see</p>
<p>The special place my dearest Lord,</p>
  <p class="i1">In love, prepares for me!</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Knowing something of those people outside the
church doors, I have often thought what an edifying
sight it would be if the Lord deigned to listen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
take a few of them at their word. If the fearless
Christ were here on earth again, what crowds of cheats
and humbugs he would drive out of the Temple! And
foremost, I fancy, would go the people who, instead of
thanking their Maker who allows the blessed sun to
shine, the birds to sing, and the flowers to grow for
them here, howl and whine lies about longing for the
joy of moving on to the better world, to the &ldquo;special
place&rdquo; that is prepared for them. If there be a better
world, it will be too good for hypocrites.</p>

<p>After hymn the fifth, Dr. Talmage takes the floor.
The audience settled in their seats in evident anticipation
of a good time, and it was soon clear to me that
the discourse was not to be dull at any rate. But I
waited in vain for a great thought, a lofty idea, or refined
language. There came none. Nothing but commonplaces
given out with tricks of voice and the gestures
of a consummate actor. The modulations of the
voice have been studied with care, no single platform
trick was missing.</p>

<p>The doctor comes on the stage, which is about forty
feet wide. He begins slowly. The flow of language
is great, and he is never at a loss for a word. Motionless,
in his lowest tones, he puts a question to us.
Nobody replies, of course. Thereupon he paces wildly
up and down the whole length of the stage. Then,
bringing up in full view of his auditors, he stares at
them, crosses his arms, gives a double and tremendous
stamp on the boards, and in a terrific voice he repeats
the question, and answers it. The desired effect is
produced: he never misses fire.</p>

<p>Being an old stager of several years&rsquo; standing myself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
I admire him professionally. Nobody is edified,
nobody is regenerated, nobody is improved, but all are
entertained. It is not a divine service, but it is a
clever performance, and the Americans never fail to
patronize a clever performance. All styles go down
with them. They will give a hearing to everybody
but the bore, especially on Sundays, when other forms
of entertainment are out of the running.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:352px; height:300px" src="images/img274.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DESIRED EFFECT.</p></div>

<p>It is not only the Brooklyn public that are treated
to the discourses of Dr. Talmage, but the whole of
America. He syndicates his sermons, and they are
published in Monday&rsquo;s newspapers in all quarters of
America. I have also seen them reproduced in the
Australian papers.</p>

<p>The delivery of these orations by Dr. Talmage is so
superior to the matter they are made of, that to read
them is slow indeed compared to hearing them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span> </p>

<p>At the back of the programme was a flaring advertisement
of Dr. Talmage&rsquo;s paper, called:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="center1">CHRISTIAN HERALD AND SIGNS OF OUR TIMES.</p>

<p>A live, undenominational, illustrated Christian paper, with a

<p class="rt"><i>Petersburg, Va.</i>, <i>March</i> 3.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Left</span> New York last night
and arrived here at
noon. No change
in the
scenery.
The same burnt-up fields,
the same placards all over
the land. The roofs of
houses, the trees in the forests,
the fences in the fields, all
announce to the world the magic
properties of castor oil, aperients,
and liver pills.</p>

<p>A little village inn in the bottom
of old Brittany is a palace of
comfort compared to the best
hotel of a Virginia town. I feel
wretched. My bedroom is so
dirty that I shall not dare to
undress to-night. I have just had lunch: a piece
of tough dried-up beef, custard pie, and a glass of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
filthy water, the whole served by an old negro on an
old, ragged, dirty table-cloth.</p>

<p>Petersburg, which awakes so many souvenirs of the
War of Secession, is a pretty town scattered with
beautiful villas. It strikes one as a provincial town.
To me, coming from the busy North, it looks asleep.
The South has not yet recovered from its disasters of
thirty years ago. That is what struck me most, when,
two years ago, I went through Virginia, Carolina, and
Georgia.</p>

<p>Now and then American eccentricity reveals itself.
I have just seen a church built on the model of a Greek
temple, and surmounted with a pointed spire lately
added. Just imagine to yourself Julius Cæsar with
his toga and buskin on, and having a chimney-top hat
on his head.</p>

<p>The streets seemed deserted, dead.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the Opera House was crowded to-night.
The audience was fashionable and appreciative,
but very cool, almost as cool as in Connecticut and
Maine.</p>

<p>Heaven be praised! a gentleman invited me to have
supper at a club after the lecture.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>March</i> 4.</p>

<p>I am sore all over. I spent the night on the bed,
outside, in my day clothes, and am bruised all over. I
have pains in my gums too. Oh, that piece of beef
yesterday! I am off to Philadelphia. My bill at the
hotel amounts to $1.50. Never did I pay so much
through the nose for what I had through the mouth.</p>

<p>From Petersburg to Richmond I was the only occupant
of the parlor car. It was bitterly cold. The
conductor of the train came in the smoke-room, and
took a seat. I suppose it was his right, although I
doubt it, for he was not the conductor attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
parlor car. He opened the window. The cold, icy air
fell on my legs, or (to use a more proper expression, as I
am writing in Philadelphia) on my lower limbs. I said
nothing, but rose and closed the window. The fellow
frowned, rose, and opened the window again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I thought that perhaps you
had come here to look after my comfort. If you
have not I will look after it myself.&rdquo; And I rose and
closed the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the window open,&rdquo; said the conductor, and
he prepared to re-open it, giving me a mute, impudent
scowl.</p>

<p>I was fairly roused. Nature has gifted me with a
biceps and a grip of remarkable power. I seized the
man by the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As true as I am alive,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;if you open
this window, I will pitch you out of it.&rdquo; And I prepared
for war. The cur sneaked away and made an
exit compared to which a whipped hound&rsquo;s would be
majestic.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I am at the Bellevue, a delightful hotel. My friend
Wilson Barrett is here, and I have come to spend the
day with him. He is playing every night to crowded
houses, and after each performance he has to make a
speech. This is his third visit to Philadelphia. During
the first visit, he tells me that the audience wanted
a speech after each act.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to compare notes with a
friend who has been over the same ground as yourself.
So I was eager to hear Mr. Wilson Barrett&rsquo;s impressions
of his long tour in the States.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span> </p>

<p>Several points we both agreed perfectly upon at
once; the charming geniality and good-fellowship of
the best Americans, the brilliancy and naturalness of
the ladies, the wonderful intelligence and activity of
the people, and the wearing monotony of life on the
road.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:346px; height:340px" src="images/img280.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE WHIPPED CONDUCTOR.</p></div>

<p>After the scene in the train, I was interested, too, to
find that the train conductors&mdash;those mute, magnificent
monarchs of the railroad&mdash;had awakened in Mr. Barrett
much the same feeling as in myself. We Europeans
are used to a form of obedience or, at least, deference
from our paid servants, and the arrogant attitude of
the American wage-earner first amazes, and then enrages
us&mdash;when we have not enough humor, or good-humor,
to get some amusement out it. It is so novel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
to be tyrannized over by people whom you pay to
attend to your comfort! The American keeps his
temper under the process, for he is the best-humored
fellow in the world. Besides, a small squabble is no
more in his line than a small anything else. It is not
worth his while. The Westerner may pull out a pistol
and shoot you if you annoy him, but neither he nor
the Eastern man will wrangle for mastery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:378px; height:430px" src="images/img281.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A BOSS.</p></div>

<p>If such was not the case, do you believe for a moment
that the Americans would submit to the rule of
the &ldquo;Rings,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Leaders,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Bosses&rdquo;?</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>I like Philadelphia, with its magnificent park, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
beautiful houses that look like homes. It is not brand
new, like the rest of America.</p>

<p>My friend, Mr. J. M. Stoddart, editor of <i>Lippincott&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, has kindly chaperoned me all the day.</p>

<p>I visited in detail the State House, Independence
Square. These words evoke sentiments of patriotism
in the hearts of the Americans. Here was the bell
that &ldquo;proclaimed liberty throughout the Colonies&rdquo; so
loudly that it split. It was on the 8th of July, 1776,
that the bell was rung, as the public reading of the
Declaration of Independence took place in the State
House on that day,
and there were great
rejoicings. John
Adams, writing to
Samuel Chase on the
9th of July, said:
&ldquo;The bell rang all
day, and almost all
night.&rdquo;</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE OLD LIBERTY BELL.</td></tr></table>

<p>It is recorded by
one writer that, on
the 4th of July, when
the motion to adopt
the declaration
passed the majority
of the Assembly, although
not signed
by all the delegates, the old bell-ringer awaited anxiously,
with trembling hope, the signing. He kept saying:
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never do it, they&rsquo;ll never do it!&rdquo; but his
eyes expanded, and his grasp grew firm when the voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
of a blue-eyed youth reached his ears in shouts of triumph
as he flew up the stairs of the tower, shouting:
&ldquo;Ring, grandpa, ring; they&rsquo;ve signed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a day this old &ldquo;Liberty Bell&rdquo; reminds you
of!</p>

<p>There, in the Independence Hall, the delegates were
gathered. Benjamin Harrison, the ancestor of the
present occupier of the White House, seized John
Hancock, upon whose head a price was set, in his arms,
and placing him in the presidential chair, said: &ldquo;We
will show Mother Britain how little we care for her, by
making our president a Massachusetts man, whom she
has excluded from pardon by public proclamation,&rdquo;
and, says Mr. Chauncey M. Depew in one of his beautiful
orations, when they were signing the Declaration,
and the slender Elbridge Gerry uttered the grim pleasantry,
&ldquo;We must hang together, or surely we will hang
separately,&rdquo; the portly Harrison responded with more
daring humor, &ldquo;It will be all over with me in a moment,
but you will be
kicking in the air half
an hour after I am
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The National Museum
is the auxiliary
chamber to Independence
Hall, and there
you find many most
interesting relics of Colonial
and Revolutionary
days: the silver inkstand used in signing the
famous Declaration; Hancock&rsquo;s chair; the little table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
upon which the document was signed, and hundreds
of souvenirs piously preserved by generations of
grateful Americans.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>It is said that Philadelphia has produced only two
successful men, Mr. Wanamaker, the great dry-goods-store
man, now a member of President Benjamin Harrison&rsquo;s
Cabinet, and Mr. George W. Childs, proprietor
of the Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger</i>, one of the most important
and successful newspapers in the United States.</p>

<p>I went to Mr. Wanamaker&rsquo;s dry-goods-store, an establishment
strongly reminding you of the Paris <i>Bon
Marché</i>, or Mr. Whiteley&rsquo;s warehouses in London.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting visit was that which I
paid to Mr. George W. Childs in his study at the <i>Public
Ledger&rsquo;s</i> offices. It would require a whole volume to
describe in detail all the treasures that Mr. Childs has
accumulated: curios of all kinds, rare books, manuscripts
and autographs, portraits, china, relics from the
celebrities of the world, etc. Mr. Childs, like the
Prussians during their unwelcome visit to France in
1870, has a strong <i>penchant</i> for clocks. Indeed his collection
is the most remarkable in existence. His study
is a beautiful <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>; it is also a museum
that not only the richest lover of art would be proud to
possess, but that any nation would be too glad to acquire,
if it could be acquired; but Mr. Childs is a very
wealthy man, and he means to keep it, and, I understand,
to hand it over to his successor in the ownership
of the <i>Public Ledger</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. George W. Childs is a man of about fifty years
of age, short and plump, with a most kind and amiable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
face. His munificence and philanthropy are well
known and, as I understand his character, I believe he
would not think much of my gratitude to him for the
kindness he showed me if I dwelt on them in these
pages.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Thanks to my kind friends, every minute has been
occupied visiting some interesting place, or meeting
some interesting people. I shall lecture here next
month, and shall look forward to the pleasure of being
in Philadelphia again.</p>

<p class="caption">WHEN IRELAND IS FREE.</p></div>

<p>At the Union League Club I met Mr. Rufus E.
Shapley, who kindly gave me a copy of his clever and
witty political satire, &ldquo;Solid for Mulhooly,&rdquo; illustrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
by Mr. Thomas Nast. I should advise any one who
would understand how Jonathan is ruled municipally,
to peruse this little book. It gives the history of
Pat&rsquo;s rise from the Irish cabin in Connaught to the
City Hall of the large American cities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When one man,&rdquo; says Mr. Shapley, &ldquo;owns and dominates
four wards or counties, he becomes a leader.
Half a dozen such leaders combined constitute what is
called a Ring. When one leader is powerful enough
to bring three or four such leaders under his yoke,
he becomes a Boss; and a Boss wields a power almost
as absolute, while it lasts, as that of the Czar of Russia
or the King of Zululand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Extracts from this book would not do it justice. It
should be read in its entirety. I read it with all the
more pleasure that, in &ldquo;Jonathan and His Continent,&rdquo;
I ventured to say: &ldquo;The English are always wondering
why Americans all seem to be in favor of Home
Rule, and ready to back up the cause with their dollars.
Why? I will tell you. Because they are in hopes
that, when the Irish recover the possession of Ireland,
they will all go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A foreigner who criticises a nation is happy to see
his opinions shared by the natives.</p>

<p class="tt1">My Ideas of the State of Texas&mdash;Why I Will
Not Go There&mdash;The Story of a Frontier Man.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>March</i> 5.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Have</span> had cold audiences in Maine and Connecticut;
and indifferent ones in several cities,
while I have been warmly received in many others.
It seems that, if I went to Texas, I might get it
hot.</p>

<p>I have received to-day a Texas paper containing a
short editorial marked at the four corners in blue pencil.
Impossible not to see it. The editorial abuses
me from the first line to the last. When there appears
in a paper an article, or even only a short paragraph,
abusing you, you never run the risk of not seeing it.
There always is, somewhere, a kind friend who will
post it to you. He thinks you may be getting a little
conceited, and he forwards the article to you, that you
may use it as wholesome physic. It does him good,
and does you no harm.</p>

<p>The article in question begins by charging me with
having turned America and the Americans into ridicule,
goes on wondering that the Americans can receive me
so well everywhere, and, after pitching into me right
and left, winds up by warning me that, if I should go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
to Texas, I might for a change meet with a hot reception.</p>

<p>A shot, perhaps.</p>

<p>A shot in Texas! No, no, no.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go to Texas. I should strongly object
to being shot anywhere, but especially in Texas,
where the event would attract so little public
attention.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;A SHOT IN TEXAS.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Yet, I should have liked to go to Texas, for was it
not from that State that, after the publication of
&ldquo;Jonathan and His Continent,&rdquo; I received the two
following letters, which I have kept among my treasures?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span> </p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="sc">Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I have read your book on America and greatly enjoyed it.
Please to send me your autograph. I enclose a ten-cent piece.
The postage will cost you five cents. Don&rsquo;t trouble about the
change.</p>

<p class="sc">My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I have an album containing the photographs of many well-known
people from Europe as well as from America. I should
much like to add yours to the number. If you will send it to me, I
will send you mine and that of my wife in return.</p></div>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>And I also imagine that there must be in Texas a
delightful primitiveness of manners and good-fellowship.</p>

<p>A friend once related to me the following reminiscence:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I arrived one evening in a little Texas town, and asked for a
bedroom at the hotel.</p>

<p>There was no bedroom to be had, but only a bed in a double-bedded
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will that suit you?&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said hesitatingly. &ldquo;Who is the
other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;you may set your mind at
rest on that subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I will take that bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At about ten o&rsquo;clock, as I was preparing to go to bed, my bedroom
companion entered. It was a frontier man in full uniform:
Buffalo Bill hat, leather leggings, a belt accommodating a couple
of revolvers&mdash;no baggage of any kind.</p>

<p>I did not like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, stranger,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty well,&rdquo; I replied, without meaning a word of it.</p>

<p>The frontier man undressed, that is to say, took off his boots,
placed the two revolvers under his pillows and lay down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span> </p>

<p>I liked it less and less.</p>

<p>By and by, we both went to sleep. In the morning we woke up
at the same time. He rose, dressed&mdash;that is to say, put on his
boots, and wished me good-morning.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:377px; height:430px" src="images/img290.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MY ROOM-MATE.</p></div>

<div class="quote">
<p>The hall porter came with letters for my companion, but none
for me. I thought I should like to let that man know I had no
money with me. So I said to him:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much disappointed. I expected some money from
New York, and it has not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will come,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>I did not like that hope.</p>

<p>In the evening, we met again. He undressed&mdash;you know, went
to sleep, rose early in the morning, dressed&mdash;you know.</p>

<p>The porter came again with letters for him and none for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your money has not come,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it has not. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be in a fix what to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to part with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The frontier man took a little piece of paper and wrote something
on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this, my friend,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it may be useful to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a check for a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>I could have gone down on my knees, as I refused the check
and asked that man&rsquo;s pardon.</p></div>

<p class="rt"><i>Cincinnati</i>, <i>March</i> 7.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">My</span> arrival in Cincinnati this morning was anything
but triumphal.</p>

<p>On leaving the car, I gave my check to a cab-driver,
who soon came to inform me that my valise was
broken. It was a leather one, and on being thrown
from the baggage-van on the platform, it burst open,
and all my things were scattered about. In England
or in France, half a dozen porters would have immediately
come to the rescue, but here the porter
is practically unknown. Three or four men belonging
to the company gathered round, but, neither out
of complaisance nor in the hope of gain, did any of
them offer his services. They looked on, laughed, and
enjoyed the scene. I daresay the betting was brisk as
to whether I should succeed in putting my things
together or not. Thanks to a leather strap I had in
my bag, I managed to bind the portmanteau and have
it placed on the cab that drove to the Burnet House.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span> </p>

<p>Immediately after registering my name, I went to
buy an American trunk, that is to say, an iron-bound
trunk, to place my things in safety. I have been told
that trunk makers give a commission to the railway
and transfer baggagemen who, having broken trunks,
recommend their owners to go to such and such a
place to buy new ones. This goes a long way toward
explaining the way in which baggage is treated in
America.</p>

<p>On arriving in the dining-room, I was surprised to
see the glasses of all the guests filled with lemonade.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;here is actually an hotel which
is not like all the other hotels.&rdquo; The lemonade turned
out to be water from the Ohio River. I could not help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
feeling grateful for a change; any change, even that
of the color of water. Anybody who has traveled
a great deal in America will appreciate the
remark.</p>

<p>Cincinnati is built at the bottom of a funnel from
which rise hundreds of chimneys vomiting fire and
smoke. From the neighboring heights, the city looks
like a huge furnace, and so it is, a furnace of industry
and activity. It reminded me of Glasgow.</p>

<p>If the city itself is anything but attractive, the residential
parts are perfectly lovely. I have seen nothing
in America that surpasses Burnet Wood, situated on
the bordering heights of the town, scattered with
beautiful villas, and itself a mixture of a wilderness
and a lovely park. A kind friend drove me for three
hours through the entire neighborhood, giving me, in
American fashion, the history of the owner of each
residence we passed. Here was the house of Mr. A.,
or rather Mr. A. B. C, every American having three
names. He came to the city twenty years ago without
a dollar. Five years later he had five millions.
He speculated and lost all, went to Chicago and made
millions, which he afterward lost. Now again he has
several millions, and so on. This is common enough in
America. By and by, we passed the most beautiful of
all the villas of Burnet Wood&mdash;the house of the Oil
King, Mr. Alexander Macdonald, one of those wonderfully
successful men, such as Scotland alone can
boast all the world over. America has been a great
field for the display of Scotch intelligence and industry.</p>

<p>After visiting the pretty museum at Eden Park, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
museum organized in 1880 in consequence of Mr.
Charles W. West&rsquo;s offer to give $150,000 for that purpose,
and already in possession of very good works of
art and many valuable treasures, we returned to the
city and stopped at the Public Library. Over 200,000
volumes, representing all the branches of science and
literature, are there, as well as a collection of all the
newspapers of the world, placed in chronological order
on the shelves and neatly bound. I believe that this
collection of newspapers and that of Washington are
the two best known. In the public reading-room,
hundreds of people are running over the newspapers
from Europe and all the principal cities of the United
States. My best thanks are due to Mr. Whelpley, the
librarian, for his kindness in conducting me all over
this interesting place. Upstairs I was shown the
room where the members of the Council of Education
hold their sittings. The room was all topsy-turvey.
Twenty-six desks and twenty-six chairs was about all
the furniture of the room. In a corner, piled up together,
were the cuspidores. I counted. Twenty-six.
Right.</p>

<p>After thanking my kind pilot, I returned to the
Burnet House to read the evening papers. I read that
the next day I was to breakfast with Mr. A., lunch
with Mr. B., and dine with Mr. C. The <i>menu</i> was not
published. I take it for granted that this piece of
intelligence is quite interesting to the readers of Cincinnati.</p>

<p>My evening being free, I looked at the column of
amusements. The first did not tempt me, it was
this:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span> </p>

<p class="center1">THE KING OF THE SWAMPS.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="center"><i>The Only and the Original.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">English Jack.</span><br />

THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE FROG MAN.</p>

<p>He makes a frog pond of his stomach by eating living frogs. An
appetite created by life in the swamps. He is so fond of this sort
of food that he takes the pretty creatures by the hind legs, and before
they can say their prayers they are inside out of the cold.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:294px; height:330px" src="images/img296.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE KING OF THE SWAMPS.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The next advertisement was that of a variety show,
that most stupid form of entertainment so popular in
America; the next was the announcement of pugilists,
and another one that of a &ldquo;most sensational drama, in
which &lsquo;one of the most emotional actresses&rsquo; in
America&rdquo; was to appear, supported by &ldquo;one of the
most powerful casts ever gathered together in the
world.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span> </p>

<p>The superlatives, in American advertisements, have
long ceased to have the slightest effect upon me.</p>

<p>The advertisement of another &ldquo;show&rdquo; ran thus: I
beg to reproduce it in its entirety; indeed it would be
a sacrilege to meddle with it.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="center1">TO THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p><i>My Friends and Former Patrons</i>: I have now been before
the public for the past seventeen years, and am perhaps too well
known to require further evidence of my character and integrity
than my past life and record will show. Fifteen years ago I inaugurated
the system of dispensing presents to the public, believing
that a fair share of my profits could thus honestly be returned
to my patrons. At the outset, and ever since, it has been my aim
to deal honestly toward the multitude who have given me patronage.
Since that time many imitators have undertaken to beguile
the public, with but varying success. Many unprincipled rascals
have also appeared upon the scene, men without talent, but far-reaching
talons, who by specious promises have sought to swindle
all whom they could inveigle. This class of scoundrels do not hesitate
to make promises that they cannot and never intend to fulfill,
and should be frowned down by all honest men. They deceive the
public, leave a bad impression, and thus injure legitimate exhibitions.
Every promise I make will be faithfully fulfilled, as experience
has clearly proven that dealing uprightly with the public
brings its sure reward. All who visit my beautiful entertainment
may rely upon the same fair dealing which has been my life-long
policy, and which has always honored me with crowded houses.</p>

<p>Finally I decided on going to see a German tragedy.
I did not understand it, but the acting seemed to me
good.</p>

<p class="caption">A GERMAN TRAGEDY.</p></div>

<p>Like Milwaukee, Cincinnati possesses a very strong
German element. Indeed a whole part of the city is
entirely inhabited by a German population, and situated
on one side of the water. When you cross the bridge
in its direction, you are going &ldquo;over the Rhine,&rdquo; to
use the local expression. &ldquo;To go over the Rhine&rdquo; of
an evening means to go to one of the many German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
<i>Brauerei</i>, and have sausages and Bavarian beer for
supper.</p>

<p>The town is a very prosperous one. The Germans
in America are liked for their steadiness and industry.
An American friend even told me that the Germans
were perhaps the best patriots the United States could
boast of.</p>

<p>Patriots! The word sounded strangely to my ears.
I may be prejudiced, but I call a good patriot a man
who loves his own mother country. You may like the
land of your adoption, but you love the land of your
birth. Good patriots! I call a good brother a man
who loves his sister, not other people&rsquo;s sisters.</p>

<p>The Germans apply for their naturalization papers
the day after they have landed. I should admire their
patriotism much more if they waited a little longer before
they changed their own mother for a step-mother.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>March</i> 8.</p>

<p>I witnessed a most impressive ceremony this morning,
the funeral of the American Minister Plenipotentiary
to the Court of Berlin, whose body was brought
from Germany to his native place a few days ago. No
soldiers ordered to accompany the <i>cortège,</i> no uniforms,
but thousands of people voluntarily doing honor to
the remains of a talented and respected fellow-citizen
and townsman: a truly republican ceremony in its simplicity
and earnestness.</p>

<p>The coffin was taken to the Music Hall, a new and
beautiful building capable of accommodating thousands
of people, and placed on the platform amid evergreens
and the Stars and Stripes. In a few minutes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
the hall, decorated with taste but with appropriate
simplicity, was packed from floor to ceiling. Some
notables and friends of the late Minister sat on the
platform around the coffin, and the mayor, in the name
of the inhabitants of the city, delivered a speech, a
eulogistic funeral oration, on the deceased diplomatist.
All parties were represented in the hall, Republicans
and Democrats alike had come. America admits no
party feeling, no recollection of political differences, to
intrude upon the homage she gratefully renders to the
memory of her illustrious dead.</p>

<p>The mayor&rsquo;s speech, listened to by the crowd in respectful
silence, was much like all the speeches delivered
on such occasions, including the indispensable
sentence that &ldquo;he knew he could safely affirm that the
deceased had never made any enemies.&rdquo; When I hear
a man spoken of, after his death, as never having
made any enemies, as a Christian I admire him, but I
also come to the conclusion that he must have been a
very insignificant member of the community. But the
phrase, I should remember, is a mere piece of flattery
to the dead, in a country where death puts a stop to
all enmity, political enmity especially. The same
would be done in England, and almost everywhere.
Not in France, however, where the dead continue to
have implacable enemies for many years after they have
left the lists.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>The afternoon was pleasantly spent visiting the
town hall and the remarkable china manufactories,
which turn out very pretty, quaint, and artistic pottery.
The evening brought to the Odéon a fashionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
and most cultivated audience. I am invited to
pay a return visit to this city. I shall look forward to
the pleasure of lecturing here again in April.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>March</i> 9.</p>

<p>Spent a most agreeable Sunday in the hospitable
house of M. Fredin, the French consular agent, and
his amiable and talented wife. M. Fredin was kind
enough to call yesterday at the Burnet House.</p>

<p>As a rule, I never call on the representatives of
France in my travels abroad. If I traveled as a tourist,
I would; but traveling as a lecturer, I should be
afraid lest the object of my visits might be misconstrued,
and taken as a gentle hint to patronize me.</p>

<p>One day I had a good laugh with a French consul,
in an English town where I came to lecture. On arriving
at the hall I found a letter from this diplomatic
compatriot, in which he expressed his surprise that I
had not apprised him of my arrival. The next morning,
before leaving the town, I called on him. He
welcomed me most gracefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not let me, your consul, know that
you were coming?&rdquo; he said to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Monsieur le Consul,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;suppose I
wrote to you: &lsquo;Monsieur le Consul, I shall arrive at
N. on Friday,&rsquo; and suppose, now, just suppose, that
you answered me, &lsquo;Sir, I am glad to hear you will
arrive here on Friday, but what on earth is that to
me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw the point at once. A Frenchman always
does.</p>

<p>I like this land of conjuring. This morning I took
the street car to go on the Burnet Hills. At the foot
of the hill the car&mdash;horses, and all&mdash;enters a little house.
The house climbs the hill vertically by means of cables.
Arrived at the top of the mountain, the car comes out
of the little house and goes on its way, just as if absolutely
nothing had happened. To return to town, I
went down the hill in
the same fashion.
But if the cable should
break, you will exclaim,
where would
you be? Ah, there
you are! It does
not break. It did
once, so now they see
that it does not again.</p>

<p>In the evening
there was nothing to
see except variety
shows and wrestlers.
There was a variety
show which tempted
me, the Hermann&rsquo;s Vaudevilles. I saw on the
list of attractions the name of my friend and compatriot,
F. Trewey, the famous shadowgraphist,
and I concluded that if the other artistes were as
good in their lines as he is in his, it would be well
worth seeing. The show was very good of its kind,
and Trewey was admirable; but the audience were
not refined, and it was not his most subtle and artistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
tricks that they applauded most, but the broader
and more striking ones. After the show he and I
went &ldquo;over the Rhine.&rdquo; You know what it means.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>March</i> 11, 9 <i>a. m.</i></p>

<p>For a long time I had wished to see the wonderful
American fire brigades at work. The wish has now
been satisfied.</p>

<p>At half-past one this morning I was roused in my
bed by the galloping of horses and the shouts of people
in the street. Huge tongues of fire were licking my
window, and the heat in the room was intense. Indeed,
all around me seemed to be in a blaze, and I
took it for granted that the Burnet House was on fire.
I rose and dressed quickly, put together the few valuables
that were in my possession, and prepared to
make for the street. I soon saw, however, that it
was a block of houses opposite that was on fire, or
rather the corner house of that block.</p>

<p>The guests of the hotel were in the corridors ready
for any emergency. Had there been any wind in our
direction, the hotel was doomed. The night was calm
and wet. As soon as we became aware that no lives
were lost or in danger in the burning building, and
that it would only be a question of insurance money
to be paid by some companies, we betook ourselves to
admire the magnificent sight. For it was a magnificent
sight, this whole large building, the prey of
flames coming in torrents out of every window, the
dogged perseverance of the firemen streaming floods
of water over the roof and through the windows, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
salvage corps men penetrating through the flames
into the building in the hope of receiving the next day
a commission on all the goods and valuables saved.
A fierce battle it was between a brute element and
man. By three o&rsquo;clock the element was conquered,
but only the four walls of the building remained, which
proved to me that, with all their wonderful promptitude
and gallantry, all firemen can do when flames
have got firm hold on a building is to save the adjoining
property.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:327px; height:400px" src="images/img304.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A FIRE YARN.</p></div>

<p>I listened to the different groups of people in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
hotel. Some gave advice as to how the firemen should
set about their work, or criticised. Others related the
big fires they had witnessed, a few indulging in the
recital of the exploits they performed thereat. There
are a good many Gascons among the Americans. At
four o&rsquo;clock all danger was over, and we all retired.</p>

<p class="caption">AS THE REPORTERS SAW IT.</p></div>

<p>I was longing to read the descriptions of the fire in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
this morning&rsquo;s papers. I have now read them and am
not at all disappointed. On the contrary, they are
beyond my most sanguine expectations. Wonderful;
simply perfectly wonderful! I am now trying to
persuade myself that I really saw all that the reporters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
saw, and that I really ran great danger last night.
For, &ldquo;at every turn,&rdquo; it appears, &ldquo;the noble hotel
seemed as if it must become the prey of the fierce
element, and could only be saved by a miracle.&rdquo;
Columns and columns of details most graphically
given, sensational, blood-curdling. But all that is
nothing. You should read about the panic, and the
scenes of wild confusion in the Burnet House, when
all the good folks, who had all dressed and were looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
quietly at the fire from the windows, are described
as a crowd of people in despair: women disheveled, in
their night-dresses, running wild, and throwing themselves
in the arms of men to seek protection, and all
shrieking and panic-stricken. Such a scene of confusion
and terror you can hardly imagine. Wonderful!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<p class="tt1">A Journey if you Like&mdash;Terrible Encounter
with an American Interviewer.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>In the train to Brushville</i>, <i>March</i> 11.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Left</span> Cincinnati this morning at ten o&rsquo;clock and
shall not arrive at Brushville before seven o&rsquo;clock
to-night. I am beginning to learn how to speak
American. As I asked for my ticket this morning at
the railroad office, the clerk said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;C. H. D. or C. C. C. St. L. and St. P.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;C. H. D.,&rdquo; I replied, with perfect assurance.</p>

<p>I happened to hit on the right line for Brushville.</p>

<p>By this time I know pretty well all those combinations
of the alphabet by which the different railroad
lines of America are designated.</p>

<p>No hope of comfort or of a dinner to-day. I shall
have to change trains three times, but none of them, I
am grieved to hear, have parlor cars or dining cars.
There is something democratic about uniform cars for
all alike. I am a democrat myself, yet I have a weakness
for the parlor cars&mdash;and the dining cars.</p>

<p>At noon we stopped five minutes at a place which,
two years ago, counted six wooden huts. To-day it
has more than 5000 inhabitants, the electric light in
the streets, a public library, two hotels, four churches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
two banks, a public school, a high school, cuspidores,
toothpicks, and all the signs of American civilization.</p>

<p>I changed trains at one o&rsquo;clock at Castle Green
Junction. No hotel in the place. I inquired where
food could be obtained. A little wooden hut, on the
other side of the depot, bearing the inscription
&ldquo;Lunch Room,&rdquo; was pointed out to me. <i>Lunch</i> in
America has not the meaning that it has in England,
as I often experienced to my despair. The English
are solid people. In England <i>lunch</i> means something.
In America, it does not. However, as there was no
<i>Beware</i> written outside, I entered the place. Several
people were eating
pies, fruit
pies, pies with
crust under, and
crust over:
sealed mysteries.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">&ldquo;PEACH POY AND APPLE POY.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>&ldquo;I want something
to eat,&rdquo;
I said to a man
behind the
counter, who
was in possession
of only one eye, and hailed from Old Oireland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;d ye loike?&rdquo; replied he, winking with the
eye that was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peach poy, apricot poy, apple poy, and mince
poy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;And, shure, what more do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have always suspected something mysterious about
mince pies. At home, I eat mince pies. I also
trust my friends&rsquo; cooks. Outside, I pass. I think
that mince pies and sausages should be made at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like a little variety,&rdquo; I said to the Irishman,
&ldquo;give me a small slice of apple pie, one of apricot pie,
and another of peach pie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Irishman stared at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the mince poy?&rdquo; he
seemed to say.</p>

<p>I could see from his eye that he resented the insult
offered to his mince pies.</p>

<p>I ate my pies and returned on the platform. I was
told that the train was two hours behind time, and I
should be too late to catch the last Brushville train at
the next change.</p>

<p>I walked and smoked.</p>

<p>The three pies began to get acquainted with each
other.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Brushville</i>, <i>March</i> 12.</p>

<p>Oh, those pies!</p>

<p>At the last change yesterday, I arrived too late.
The last Brushville train was gone.</p>

<p>The pies were there.</p>

<p>A fortune I would have given for a dinner and a bed,
which now seemed more problematic than ever.</p>

<p>I went to the station-master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have a special train to take me to Brushville
to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred dollars.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;How much for a locomotive alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixty dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a freight train going to Brushville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board it! I can&rsquo;t stop the train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your life is insured?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; for a great deal more than it is worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you do it for five
dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he looked as if he was going to enjoy the fun.
The freight train arrived, slackened speed, and I
boarded, with my portmanteau
and my umbrella,
a car loaded
with timber. I placed
my handbag on the
timber&mdash;you know,
the one I had when
traveling in &ldquo;the
neighborhood of Chicago&rdquo;&mdash;sat
on it,
opened my umbrella,
and waved a &ldquo;tata&rdquo;
to the station-master.</p>

<p>It was raining fast,
and I had a journey of some thirty miles to make
at the rate of about twelve miles an hour.</p>

<p>Oh, those pies! They now seemed to have resolved
to fight it out. <i>Sacrebleu! De bleu! de bleu!</i></p>

<p>A few miles from Brushville I had to get out, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
rather, get down, and take a ticket for Brushville on
board a local train.</p>

<p>Benumbed with cold, wet through, and famished, I
arrived here at ten o&rsquo;clock last night. The peach pie,
the apple pie, and the apricot pie had settled their differences
and become on friendly and accommodating
terms.</p>

<p>I was able, on arriving at the hotel, to enjoy some
light refreshments, which I only obtained, at that time
of night, thanks to the manager, whom I had the pleasure
of knowing personally.</p>

<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock I went to bed, or, to use a more
proper expression for my Philadelphia readers, I
retired.</p>

<p>I had been &ldquo;retiring&rdquo; for about half an hour, when
I heard a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; I grumbled from under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A representative of the Brushville <i>Express</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am very sorry&mdash;but I&rsquo;m asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let me in; I won&rsquo;t detain you very long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you won&rsquo;t. Now, please do not insist. I
am tired, upset, ill, and I want rest. Come to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; answered the voice behind
the door; &ldquo;my paper appears in the morning, and I
want to put in something about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, do go away,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a good
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see you,&rdquo; insisted the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; without mentioning
any place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span> </p>

<p>For a couple of minutes there was silence, and I
thought the interviewer was gone. The illusion was
sweet, but short. There was another knock, followed
by a &ldquo;I really must see you to-night.&rdquo; Seeing that
there would be no peace until I had let the reporter
in, I unbolted the door, and jumped back into my&mdash;you
know.</p>

<p class="caption">THE INTERVIEWER.</p></div>

<p>It was pitch dark.</p>

<p>The door opened; and I heard the interviewer&rsquo;s steps
in the room. By and by, the sound of a pocket being
searched was distinct. It was his own. A match was
pulled out and struck; the premises examined and
reconnoitered.</p>

<p>A chandelier with three lights hung in the middle of
the room. The reporter, speechless and solemn,
lighted one burner, then two, then three, chose the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
most comfortable seat, and installed himself in it,
looking at me with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>I was sitting up, wild and desheveled, in my &ldquo;retiring&rdquo;
clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Que voulez-vous?</i>&rdquo; I wanted to yell, my state
of drowsiness allowing me to think only in French.</p>

<p>Instead of translating this query by &ldquo;What do you
want?&rdquo; as I should have done, if I had been in the
complete enjoyment of my intellectual faculties, I
shouted to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks, I&rsquo;m not particular,&rdquo; he calmly replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a little whisky and soda&mdash;rye whisky,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My face must have been a study as I rang for
whisky and soda.</p>

<p>The mixture was brought&mdash;for two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have no objection to my smoking?&rdquo;
coolly said the man in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;this is perfectly lovely;
I enjoy it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled out his pocket-book and his pencil, crossed
his legs, and having drawn a long whiff from his cigar,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that you have no lecture to deliver in Brushville;
may I ask you what you have come here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what the deuce is that to you? If
this is the kind of questions you have to ask me, you
go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pocketed the rebuff, and went on undisturbed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you struck with Brushville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am struck,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with the cheek of some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
the inhabitants. I have driven to this hotel from
the depot in a closed carriage, and I have seen nothing
of your city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man wrote down something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lecture to-morrow night,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;before
the students of the State University, and I have come
here for rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took this down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this, you see, is very uninteresting; so, good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I disappeared.</p>

<p>The interviewer rose and came to my side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, now that I am here, you may as well let
me have a chat with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wretch!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that
I am dying for sleep? Is there nothing sacred for
you? Have you lost all sense of charity? Have you
no mother? Don&rsquo;t you believe in future punishment?
Are you a man or a demon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me some anecdotes, some of your reminiscences
of the road,&rdquo; said the man, with a sardonic grin.</p>

<p>I made no reply. The imperturbable reporter resumed
his seat and smoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you gone?&rdquo; I sighed, from under the
blankets.</p>

<p>The answer came in the following words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir, that when you were a young
man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was <span class="sc">what</span>?&rdquo; I shouted, sitting up once
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir, that when you were <i>quite</i> a
young man,&rdquo; repeated the interviewer, with the sentence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
improved, &ldquo;you were an officer in the French
army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; I murmured, in the same position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also understand you fought during the Franco-Prussian
war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; I said, resuming a horizontal position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask you to give me some reminiscences of
the Franco-Prussian war&mdash;just enough to fill about a
column?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rose and again sat up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Free citizen of the great American Republic,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;beware, beware! There will be blood shed
in this room to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I seized my pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not meaty,&rdquo; exclaimed the reporter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I inquire what the meaning of this strange
expression is?&rdquo; I said, frowning; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak
American fluently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that there is very little to
be got out of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; I said, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bolted the door, turned out the gas, and &ldquo;re-retired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;perhaps he relied on me
to supply him with material for a column. I might
have chatted with him. After all, these reporters
have invariably been kind to me. I might as well
have obliged him. What is he going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I dreamed that he was dismissed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span> </p>

<p>I ought to have known better.</p>

<p>This morning I opened the Brushville <i>Express</i>, and,
to my stupefaction, saw a column about me. My
impressions of Brushville, that I had no opportunity
of looking at, were there. Nay, more. I would blush
to record here the exploits I performed during the
Franco-Prussian war, as related by my interviewer,
especially those which took place at the battle of
Gravelotte, where, unfortunately, I was not present.
The whole thing was well written. The reference to
my military services began thus: &ldquo;Last night a hero
of the great Franco-Prussian war slept under the hospitable
roof of Morrison Hotel, in this city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slept!&rdquo; This was adding insult to injury.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>This morning I had the visit of two more reporters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of Brushville?&rdquo; they said;
and, seeing that I would not answer the question, they
volunteered information on Brushville, and talked
loud on the subject. I have no doubt that the afternoon
papers will publish my impressions of Brushville.</p>

<p>If Saunders has made his peace with God, I hope

<p>Arrived here yesterday afternoon. Met James Whitcomb
Riley, the Hoosier poet. Mr. Riley is a man of
about thirty, a genuine poet, full of pathos and humor,
and a great reciter. No one, I imagine, could give his
poetry as he does himself. He is a born actor, who
holds you in suspense, and makes you cry or laugh
just as he pleases. I remember, when two years ago
Mr. Augustin Daly gave a farewell supper to Mr. Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
Irving and Miss Ellen Terry at Delmonico&rsquo;s, Mr. Riley
recited one of his poems at table. He gave most of us
a big lump in our throats, and Miss Terry had tears
rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>The veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic
are having a great field day in Indianapolis. They
have come here to attend meetings and ask for pensions,
so as to reduce that unmanageable surplus. Indianapolis
is full, and the management of Denison
House does not know which way to turn. All these
veterans have large, broad-brimmed soft hats and are
covered all over with badges and ribbons. Their wives
and daughters, members of some patriotic association,
have come with them. It is a huge picnic. The entrance
hall is crowded all day. The spittoons have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
been replaced by tubs for the occasion. Chewing is in
favor all over America, but the State of Indiana beats,
in that way, everything I have seen before.</p>

<p>Went to see Clara Morris in Adolphe Belot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Article
47,&rdquo; at the Opera House, last night. Clara Morris
is a powerful actress, but, like most actors and actresses
who go &ldquo;starring&rdquo; through America, badly supported.
I watched the audience with great interest. Nineteen
mouths out of twenty were chewing&mdash;the men tobacco,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
the women gum impregnated with peppermint. All
the jaws were going like those of so many ruminants
grazing in a field. From the box I occupied the sight
was most amusing.</p>

<p>On returning to Denison House from the theater, I
went to have a smoke in a quiet corner of the hall, far
from the crowd. By and by two men, most smartly
dressed, with diamond pins in their cravats, and flowers
embroidered on their waistcoats, came and sat opposite
me. I thought they had chosen the place to have a
quiet chat together. Not so. One pushed a cuspidore
with his foot and brought it between the two chairs.
There, for half an hour, without saying one word to
each other, they chewed, hawked, and spat&mdash;and had
a good time before going to bed.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Trewey is nowhere as an equilibrist, compared to a
gallant veteran who breakfasted at my table, this morning.
Among the different courses brought to him
were two boiled eggs, almost raw, poured into a tumbler
according to the American fashion. Without
spilling a drop, he managed to eat those eggs with the
end of his knife. It was marvelous. I have never
seen the like of it, even in Germany, where the knife
trick is practiced from the tenderest age.</p>

<p>In Europe, swaggering little boys smoke; here they
chew and spit, and look at you, as if to say: &ldquo;See
what a big man I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Chicago</i>, <i>March</i> 15.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Arrived</span> here this morning and put up at the
Grand Pacific Hotel. My lecture to-night at the
Central Music Hall is advertised as a <i>causerie</i>. My
local manager informs me that many people have inquired
at the box-office what the meaning of that
French word is. As he does not know himself, he
could not enlighten them, but he thinks that curiosity
will draw a good crowd to-night.</p>

<p>This puts me in mind of a little incident which took
place about a year ago. I was to make my appearance
before an afternoon audience in the fashionable town
of Eastbourne. Not wishing to convey the idea of a
serious and prosy discourse, I advised my manager to
call the entertainment &ldquo;<i>A causerie</i>.&rdquo; The room was
full and the affair passed off very well. But an old
lady, who was a well-known patroness of such entertainments,
did not put in an appearance. On being
asked the next day why she was not present, she
replied: &ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, when I saw that
they had given the entertainment a French name, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
was afraid it might be something not quite fit for me
to hear.&rdquo; Dear soul!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>March</i> 16.</p>

<p>My manager&rsquo;s predictions were realized last night.
I had a large audience, one of the keenest and the most
responsive and appreciative I have ever had. I was
introduced by Judge Elliott Anthony, of the Superior
Court, in a short, witty, and graceful little speech. He
spoke of Lafayette and of the debt of gratitude America
owes to France for the help she received at her hands
during the War of Independence. Before taking leave
of me, Judge Anthony kindly invited me to pay a
visit to the Superior Court next Wednesday.</p>

<p>Dined yesterday with Mr. James W. Scott, proprietor
of the Chicago <i>Herald</i>, one of the most flourishing
newspapers in the United States, and in the evening
went to see Richard Mansfield in &ldquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde.&rdquo; The play is a repulsive one, but the double
impersonation gives the great actor a magnificent
opportunity for the display of his histrionic powers.
The house was crowded, though it was Sunday. The
pick of Chicago society was not there, of course. Some
years ago, I was told, a Sunday audience was mainly
composed of men. To-day the women go as freely as
the men. The &ldquo;horrible&rdquo; always has a great fascination
for the masses, and Mansfield held his popular
audience in a state of breathless suspense. There was
a great deal of disappointment written on the faces
when the light was turned down on the appearance of
&ldquo;Mr. Hyde,&rdquo; with his horribly distorted features. A
woman, sitting in a box next to the one I occupied,
exclaimed, as &ldquo;Hyde&rdquo; came to explain his terrible
secret to the doctor, in the fourth act, &ldquo;What a shame,
they are turning down the light again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spent yesterday in recreation intellectual&mdash;and
otherwise. I like to see everything, and I have no
objection to entering a dime museum. I went to one
yesterday morning, and saw a bearded lady, a calf with
two heads, a gorilla (stuffed), a girl with no arms, and
other freaks of nature. The bearded lady had very,
very masculine features, but <i>honi soit qui mal y pense</i>.
I could not help thinking of one of General Horace
Porter&rsquo;s good stories. A school-master asks a little
boy what his father is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, papa told me not to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, it&rsquo;s all right with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, he is the bearded lady at the dime
museum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the museum I went to the free library in the
City Hall. Dime museums and free libraries&mdash;such is
America. The attendance at the free libraries increases
rapidly every day, and the till at the dime museums
diminishes with proportionate rapidity.</p>

<p>After lunch I paid a visit to the exhibition of Vassili
Vereschagin&rsquo;s pictures. What on earth could possess
the talented Russian artist, whose coloring is so lovely,
to expend his labor on such subjects! Pictures like
those, which show the horrors of a campaign in all
their hideousness, may serve a good purpose in creating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
a detestation of war in all who see them. Nothing
short of such a motive in the artist could excuse the
portrayal of such infamies. These pictures are so
many nightmares which will certainly haunt my eyes
and brain for days and nights to come. Battle scenes
portrayed with a realism
that is revolting,
because, alas, only too
true. The execution
of nihilists in a dim,
dreary, snow-covered
waste. An execution
of sepoys, the doomed
rebels tied to the
mouths of cannon
about to be fired off.
Scenes of torture, illustrative
of the extent
to which human
suffering can be carried,
give you cold
shudders in every fiber
of your body. One
horrid canvas shows
a deserted battlefield,
the snow-covered
ground littered with corpses that ravens are tearing
and fighting for. But, perhaps worst of all, is a
picture of a field, where, in the snow, lie the human
remains of a company of Russian soldiers who have
been surprised and slain by Turks. Among the bodies,
outraged by horrible and nameless mutilations, walks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
a priest, swinging a censer. One seems to be pursued
by, and impregnated with, a smell of cadaverous putrefaction.
This collection of pictures is installed in a
place which has been used for stabling horses in, and is
reeking with stable odors and the carbolic acid that
has been employed to neutralize them. Your sense of
smell is in full sympathy with your horrified sense of
sight: both are revolted.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Now, behind the three large rooms devoted to the
Russian artist&rsquo;s works was a small one, in which hung a
single picture. You little guess that that picture was
no other than Jean Francois Millet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Angelus.&rdquo;
Millet&rsquo;s dear little &ldquo;Angelus,&rdquo; that hymn of resignation
and peace, alongside of all this roar and carnage
of battle! The exhibitor thought, perhaps, that a
sedative might be needed after the strong dose of
Vassili Vereschagin, but I imagine that no one who
went into that little room after the others was in a
mood to listen to Millet&rsquo;s message.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>March</i> 19.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I went to see the Richmond
Libby Prison, a four-story, huge brick building which
has been removed here from Richmond, over a distance
of more than a thousand miles, across the mountains
of Pennsylvania. This is, perhaps, as the circular
says, an unparalleled feat in the history of the
world. The prison has been converted into a museum,
illustrating the Civil War and African Slavery in America.
The visit proved very interesting. In the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
I had a drive through the beautiful parks of the
city.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to see &ldquo;Tannhäuser&rdquo; at the
Auditorium. Outside, the building looks more like a
penitentiary than a place of amusement&mdash;a huge pile
of masonry, built of great, rough, black-looking blocks
of stone. Inside, it is magnificent. I do not know
anything to compare with it for comfort, grandeur, and
beauty. It can hold seven thousand people. The
decorations are white and gold. The lighting is done
by means of arc electric lights in the enormously lofty
roof&mdash;lights which can be lowered at will. Mr. Peck
kindly took me to see the inner workings of the stage.
I should say &ldquo;stages,&rdquo; for there are three. The hydraulic
machinery for raising and lowering them cost
$200,000.</p>

<p>Madame Lehmann sang grandly. I imagine that
she is the finest lady exponent of Wagner&rsquo;s music alive.
She not only sings the parts, but looks them. Built
on grand lines and crowned with masses of blond
hair, she seems, when she gives forth those volumes of
clear tones, a Norse goddess strayed into the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>M. Gounod describes Wagner as an astounding
prodigy, an aberration of genius, a dreamer haunted
by the colossal. For years I had listened to Wagner&rsquo;s
music, and, like most of my compatriots, brought up
on the tuneful airs of Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini, Verdi,
Auber, etc., I entirely failed to appreciate the music of
the future. All I could say in its favor was some variation
of the sentiment once expressed by Mr. Edgar
W. Nye (&ldquo;Bill Nye&rdquo;) who, after giving the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
his mature consideration, said he came to the conclusion
that Wagner&rsquo;s music was not so bad as it sounded.
But I own that since I went to Bayreuth and heard
and saw the operas as there given, I began not only to
see that they are beautiful, but why they are beautiful.</p>

<p>Wagnerian opera is a poetical and musical idealization
of speech.</p>

<p>The fault that I, like many others, have fallen into,
was that of listening to the voices instead of listening
to the orchestra. The fact is, the voices could almost
be dispensed with altogether. The orchestra gives
you the beautiful poem in music, and the personages on
the stage are really little more than illustrative puppets.
They play about the same part in the work that
pictures play in a book. Wagner&rsquo;s method was something
so new, so different to all we had been accustomed
to, that it naturally provoked much indignation
and enmity&mdash;not because it was bad, but because it
was new. It was the old story of the Classicists and
Romanticists over again.</p>

<p>If you wanted to write a symphony, illustrative of
the pangs and miseries of a sufferer from toothache,
you would, if you were a disciple of Wagner, write
your orchestral score so that the instruments should
convey to the listener the whole gamut of groans&mdash;the
temporary relief, the return of the pain, the sudden
disappearance of it on ringing the bell at the dentist&rsquo;s
door, the final wrench of extraction gone through by
the poor patient. On the boards you would put a
personage who, with voice and contortions, should
help you, as pictorial illustrations help an author.
Such is the Wagnerian method.

<p class="caption">&ldquo;A TERRIBLE WAGNERITE.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>After the play I met a terrible Wagnerite. Most
Wagnerites are terrible. They will not admit that
anything can be discussed, much less criticised, in the
works of the master. They are not admirers, disciples;
they are worshipers. To them Wagner&rsquo;s music is as
perfect as America is to many a good-humored American.
They will tell you that never have horses neighed
so realistically as they do in the &ldquo;Walküre.&rdquo; Answer
that this is almost lowering music to the level of
ventriloquism, and they will declare you a profane, unworthy
to live. My Wagnerite friend told me last night
that Wagner&rsquo;s work constantly improved till it reached
perfection in &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, quite seriously,
&ldquo;the music has reached such a state of perfection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
that, in the garden scene, you can smell the violets
and the roses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I heard &lsquo;Parsifal&rsquo; in Bayreuth,
and I must confess that it is, perhaps, the only
work of Wagner&rsquo;s that I cannot understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard it thirty-four times,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
enjoyed it more the thirty-fourth time than I did the
thirty-third.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;perhaps it has to be heard
fifty times before it can be thoroughly appreciated.
In which case, you must own that life is too short to
enable one to see an opera fifty times in order to enjoy
it as it should really be enjoyed. I don&rsquo;t care what
science there is about music, or what labors a musician
should have to go through. As one of the public, I say
that music is a recreation, and should be understood at
once. Auber, for example, with his delightful airs,
that three generations of men have sung on their way
home from the opera house, has been a greater benefactor
of the human race than Wagner. I prefer
music written for the heart to music written for the
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On hearing me mention Auber&rsquo;s name in one breath
with Wagner&rsquo;s, the Wagnerite threw a glance of contempt
at me that I shall never forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, to regain his good graces, &ldquo;I may
improve yet&mdash;I will try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a rule, the Wagnerite is a man utterly destitute
of humor.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I called on Judge Elliott Anthony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
at the Superior Court. The Judge invited me
to sit by his side on the tribunal, and kindly explained
to me the procedure, as the cases went on. Certainly
kindness is not rare in Europe, but such simplicity in
a high official is only to be met with in America.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>

<p class="tt">Ann Arbor&mdash;The University of Michigan&mdash;Detroit
Again&mdash;The French Out of France&mdash;Oberlin
College, Ohio&mdash;Black and White&mdash;Are
All American Citizens Equal?</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Detroit</i>, <i>March</i> 22.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">One</span> of the most interesting and brilliant audiences
that I have yet addressed was the large one
which gathered in the lecture hall of the University of
Michigan, at Ann Arbor, last night. Two thousand
young, bright faces to gaze at from the platform is a
sight not to be easily forgotten. I succeeded in pleasing
them, and they simply delighted me.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan is, I think, the largest
in the United States.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself one thousand young men and
one thousand young women, in their early twenties,
staying together in the same boarding-houses, studying
literature, science, and the fine arts in the same class-rooms,
living happily and in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>They are not married.</p>

<p>No restraint of any sort. Even in the boarding-houses
they are allowed to meet in the sitting-rooms;
I believe that the only restriction is that, at eight
o&rsquo;clock in the evening, or at nine (I forget which), the
young ladies have to retire to their private apartments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; some European will exclaim, &ldquo;do the young
ladies&rsquo; parents trust all these young men?&rdquo; They do
much better than that, my dear friend&mdash;they trust their
daughters.</p>

<p>During eighteen years, I was told, three accidents
happened, but three marriages happily resulted.</p>

<p>The educational system of America engenders the
high morality which undoubtedly exists throughout
the whole of the United States, by accustoming women
to the companionship of men from their infancy, first
in the public schools, then in the high schools, and
finally in the universities. It explains the social life of
the country. It accounts for the delightful manner in
which men treat women. It explains the influence of
women. Receiving exactly the same education as the
men, the women are enabled to enjoy all the intellectual
pleasures of life. They are not inferior beings
intended for mere housekeepers, but women destined
to play an important part in all the stations of life.</p>

<p>No praise can be too high for a system of education
that places knowledge of the highest order at the disposal
of every child born in America. The public
schools are free, the high schools are free, and the
universities,<a name="FnAnchor_4" id="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> through the aid that they receive from
the United States and from the State in which they
are, can offer their privileges, without charge for tuition,
to all persons of either sex who are qualified by
knowledge for admission.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan comprises the Department
of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the Department
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
of Medicine and Surgery, the Department of
Law, the School of Pharmacy, the Hom&oelig;opathic
Medical College, and the College of Dental Surgery.
Each department has its special Faculty of Instruction.</p>

<p>I count 118 professors on the staff of the different
faculties.</p>

<p>The library contains 70,041 volumes, 14,626 unbound
brochures, and 514 maps and charts.</p>

<p>The University also possesses beautiful laboratories,
museums, an astronomical observatory, collections,
workshops of all sorts, a lecture hall capable of accommodating
over two thousand people, art studios, etc.,
etc. Almost every school has a building of its own,
so that the University is like a little busy town.</p>

<p>No visit that I have ever paid to a public institution
interested me so much as the short one paid to the
University of Michigan yesterday.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Dined this evening with Mr. W. H. Brearley, editor
of the Detroit <i>Journal</i>. Mr. Brearley thinks that the
Americans, who received from France such a beautiful
present as the statue of &ldquo;Liberty Enlightening the
World,&rdquo; ought to present the mother country of General
Lafayette with a token of her gratitude and affection,
and he has started a national subscription to carry out
his idea. He has already received support, moral and
substantial. I can assure him that nothing would
touch the hearts of the French people more than such
a tribute of gratitude and friendship from the other
great republic.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span> </p>

<p>In the evening I had a crowded house in the large
lecture hall of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association.</p>

<p>After the lecture, I met an interesting Frenchman
residing in Detroit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told a month ago, when I paid my first visit to
Detroit, that there were twenty-five thousand French
people living here,&rdquo; I said to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number is exaggerated, I believe,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;but certainly we are about twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have French societies, a French
Club?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Germans have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we have not.
We have tried many times to found French clubs in
this city, so as to establish friendly intercourse among
our compatriots, but we have always failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. They all wanted to be presidents,
or vice-presidents. They quarreled among
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When six Frenchmen meet to start a society,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;one will be president, two vice-presidents, one
secretary, and the other assistant-secretary. If the
sixth cannot obtain an official position, he will resign
and go about abusing the other five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was my turn to smile. Why should the French
in Detroit be different from the French all over the
world, except perhaps in their own country? A
Frenchman out of France is like a fish out of water.
He loses his native amiability and becomes a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
suspicious person, who spends his life in thinking that
everybody wants to tread on his corns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When two Frenchmen meet in a foreign land,&rdquo;
goes an old saying, &ldquo;there is one too many.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:441px; height:330px" src="images/img339.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE TWO FRENCHMEN.</p></div>

<p>In Chicago there are two Frenchmen engaged in
teaching the natives of the city &ldquo;how to speak and
write the French language correctly.&rdquo; The people of
Chicago maintain that the streets are too narrow to
let these two Frenchmen pass, when they walk in opposite
directions. And it appears that one of them
has lately started a little French paper&mdash;to abuse the
other in.</p>

<p>I think that all the faults and weaknesses of the
French can be accounted for by the presence of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
defect, jealousy; and the absence of a quality,
humor.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Oberlin, O.</i>, <i>March</i> 24.</p>

<p>Have to-night given a lecture to the students of
Oberlin College, a religious institution founded by the
late Rev. Charles Finney, the friend of the slaves, and
whose voice, they say, when he preached, shook the
earth.</p>

<p>The college is open to colored students; but in an
audience of about a thousand young men and women,
I could only discover the presence of two descendants
of Ham.</p>

<p>Originally many colored students attended at Oberlin
College, but the number steadily decreased every
year, and to-day there are only very few. The colored
student is not officially &ldquo;boycotted,&rdquo; but he has probably
discovered by this time that he is not wanted in
Oberlin College any more than in the orchestra stalls
of an American theater.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence proclaims that
&ldquo;all men are created equal,&rdquo; but I never met a man in
America (much less still a woman) who believed this
or who acted upon it.</p>

<p>The railroad companies have special cars for colored
people, and the saloons special bars. At Detroit, I
was told yesterday that a respectable and wealthy
mulatto resident, who had been refused service in one
of the leading restaurants of the town, brought an
action against the proprietor, but that, although there
was no dispute of the facts, the jury unanimously decided
against the plaintiff, who was moreover mulcted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
in costs to a heavy amount. But all this is nothing:
the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association, one of the
most representative and influential corporations in the
United States, refuses to admit colored youths to
membership.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:232px; height:330px" src="images/img341.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE NEGRO.</p></div>

<p>It is just possible that in a few years colored students
will have ceased to study at Oberlin College.</p>

<p>I can perfectly well understand that Jonathan
should not care to associate too closely with the colored
people, for, although they do not inspire me with
repulsion, still I cannot imagine&mdash;well, I cannot understand
for one thing how the mulatto can exist.</p>

<p>But since the American has to live alongside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
negro, would it not be worth his while to treat him
politely and honestly, give him his due as an equal, if
not in his eyes, at any rate in the eyes of the law?
Would it not be worth his while to remember that the
&ldquo;darky&rdquo; cannot be gradually disposed of like the
Indian, for Sambo adapts himself to his surroundings,
multiplies apace, goes to school, and knows how to
read, write, and reckon. Reckon especially.</p>

<p>It might be well to remember, too, that all the greatest,
bloodiest revolutions the world has ever seen were
set on foot, not to pay off hardships, but as revenge
for injustice. &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; was called a romance,
nothing but a romance, by the aristocratic
Southerners; but, to use the Carlylian phrase, their
skins went to bind the hundreds of editions of that
book. Another &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; may yet appear.</p>

<p>America will have &ldquo;to work her thinking machine&rdquo;
seriously on this subject, and that before many years
are over. If the next Presidential election is not run
on the negro question, the succeeding one surely will
be.</p>

<p class="tt">Mr. and Mrs. Kendal in New York&mdash;Joseph
Jefferson&mdash;Julian Hawthorne&mdash;Miss Ada
Rehan&mdash;&ldquo;As You Like It&rdquo; at Daly&rsquo;s
Theater.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>March</i> 28.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">The</span> New York papers this morning announce that
the &ldquo;Society of Young Girls of Pure Character
on the Stage&rdquo; give a lunch to Mrs. Kendal to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Kendal have conquered America.
Their tour is a triumphal march through the United
States, a huge success artistically, financially, and
socially.</p>

<p>I am not surprised at it. I went to see them a
few days ago in &ldquo;The Ironmaster,&rdquo; and they delighted
me. As <i>Claire</i> Mrs. Kendal was admirable.
She almost succeeded in making me forget Madame
Jane Hading, who created the part at the Gymnase, in
Paris, six years ago.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>This morning Mr. Joseph Jefferson called on me at
the Everett House. The veteran actor, who looks
more like a man of fifty than like one of over sixty, is
now playing with Mr. William J. Florence in &ldquo;The
Rivals.&rdquo; I had never seen him off the stage. I immediately
saw that the characteristics of the actor
were the characteristics of the man&mdash;kindness, naturalness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
simplicity, <i>bonhomie</i>, and <i>finesse</i>. An admirable
actor, a great artist, and a lovable man.</p>

<p>At the Down-Town Club, I lunched with the son of
Nathaniel Hawthorne&mdash;the greatest novelist that
America has yet produced&mdash;Mr. Julian Hawthorne,
himself a novelist of repute. Lately he has written a
series of sensational novels in collaboration with the
famous New York detective, Inspector Byrnes. Mr.
Julian Hawthorne is a man of about forty-five, tall,
well-proportioned, with an artistic-looking head
crowned with grayish hair, that reminds a Frenchman
of Alexandre Dumas, <i>fils</i>, and an American of Nathaniel
Hawthorne. A charming, unaffected man, and a delightful
<i>causeur</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In the evening I went to Daly&rsquo;s Theater and saw
&ldquo;As You Like It.&rdquo; That bewitching queen of actresses,
Miss Ada Rehan, played <i>Rosalind</i>. Miss Rehan
is so original that it would be perfectly impossible to
compare her to any of the other great actresses of
France and England. She is like nobody else. She
is herself. The coaxing drawl of her musical voice,
the vivacity of her movements, the whimsical spontaneity
that seems to direct her acting, her tall, handsome
figure, her beautiful, intellectual face, all tend to
make her a unique actress. She fascinates you, and
so gets hold of you, that when she is on the stage
she entirely fills it. Mr. John Drew as <i>Orlando</i> and
Mr. James Drew as <i>Touchstone</i> were admirable.</p>

<p>It matters little what the play-bill announces at
Daly&rsquo;s Theater. If I have not seen the play, I am
sure to enjoy it; if I have seen it already, I am sure
to enjoy it again.</p>

<p class="tt">Washington&mdash;The City&mdash;Willard&rsquo;s Hotel&mdash;The
Politicians&mdash;General Benjamin Harrison, U.
S. President&mdash;Washington Society&mdash;Baltimore&mdash;Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Washington</i>, <i>April</i> 3.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Arrived</span> here the day before yesterday, and
put up at Willard&rsquo;s. I prefer this huge hotel to
the other more modern houses of the capital, because
it is thoroughly American; because it is in its rotunda
that every evening the leading men of all parties and
the notables of the nation may be found; because to
meet at Willard&rsquo;s at night is as much the regular thing
as to perform any of the official functions of office
during the day; because, to use the words of a guide,
which speaks the truth, it is pleasant to live in this historical
place, in apartments where battles have been
planned and political parties have been born or
doomed to death, to become familiar with surroundings
amid which Presidents have drawn their most important
papers and have chosen their Cabinet Ministers,
and where the proud beauties of a century have
held their Court.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>On the subject of Washington hotels, I was told a
good story the other day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span> </p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:407px; height:430px" src="images/img346.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">EVENING AT WILLARD&rsquo;S.</p></div>

<p>The most fashionable hotel of this city having outgrown
its space, the proprietors sent a note to a lady,
whose back yard adjoined, to say, that, contemplating
still enlarging their hotel, they would be glad to know
at what price she would sell her yard, and they would
hand her the amount without any more discussion.
The lady, in equally Yankee style, replied that she
had been contemplating enlarging her back yard, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
was going to inquire what they would take for part of
their hotel!</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>How beautiful this city of Washington is, with its
wide avenues, its parks, and its buildings! That Capitol,
in white marble, standing on elevated ground,
against a bright blue sky, is a poem&mdash;an epic poem.</p>

<p>I am never tired of looking at the expanse of cloudless
blue that is almost constantly stretched overhead.
The sunsets are glorious. The poorest existence would
seem bearable under such skies. I am told they are
better still further West. I fancy I should enjoy to
spend some time on a farm, deep in the country, far
from the noisy, crowded streets, but I fear I am condemned
to see none but the busy haunts of Jonathan.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In the evening I went to what is called a colored
church. The place was packed with negroes of all
shades and ages; the women, some of them very
smartly dressed, and waving scarlet fans. In a pew
sat a trio truly gorgeous. Mother, in black shiny
satin, light-brown velvet mantle covered with iridescent
beads, bonnet to match. Daughter of fifteen;
costume of sky-blue satin, plush mantle, scarlet red,
chinchilla fur trimmings, white hat with feathers.
Second girl, or daughter, light-blue velvet, from top
to toe, with large hat, apple-green and gold.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:446px; height:240px" src="images/img348.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A GORGEOUS TRIO.</p></div>

<p>Every one was intently listening to the preacher, a
colored man, who gave them, in graphic language and
stentorian voice, the story of the capture of the Jews
by Cyrus, their slavery and their delivery. A low accompaniment
of &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; &ldquo;Allelujah!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
&ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; from the hearers, showed their approbation
of the discourse. From time to time, there would be
a general chuckle or laughter, and exclamations of delight
from the happy grin-lit mouths, as, for instance,
when the preacher described the supper of Belshazzar,
and the appearance of the writing on the wall, in his
own droll fashion. &ldquo;&rsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a fine supper,&rsquo; said
Belshazzar. &lsquo;Dere&rsquo;s ole Cyrus out dere, but we&rsquo;ll
have a good time and enjoy ourselves, and never mind
him.&rsquo; So he went for de cups dat had come from de
Temple of Jerusalem, and began carousin&rsquo;! Dere is
Cyrus, all de while, marchin&rsquo; his men up de bed ob de
river. I see him comin&rsquo;! I see him!&rdquo; Then he pictured
the state all that wicked party got in at the
sight of the writing nobody could read, and by this
time the excitement of the congregation was tremendous.
The preacher thought this a good opportunity to
point a moral. So he proceeded: &ldquo;Now, drink is a
poor thing; dere&rsquo;s too much of it in dis here city.&rdquo;
Here followed a picture of certain darkies, who cut a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
dash with shiny hats and canes, and frequented bars
and saloons. &ldquo;When folks take to drinkin&rsquo;, somefin&rsquo;s
sure to go wrong.&rdquo; Grins and grunts of approbation
culminated in perfect shouts of glee, as the preacher
said: &ldquo;Ole Belshazzar and de rest of &rsquo;em forgot to
shut de city gate, and in came Cyrus and his men.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:373px; height:340px" src="images/img349.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE PREACHER.</p></div>

<p>They went nearly wild with pleasure over the story
of the liberation of the Jews, and incidental remarks
on their own freeing. &ldquo;Oh, let dem go,&rdquo; said their
masters, when they found the game was up, &ldquo;dey&rsquo;ll
soon perish and die out!&rdquo; Here the preacher laughed
loudly, and then shouted: &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t die out so
easy!&rdquo; [Grins and chuckling.]</p>

<p>One old negro was very funny to watch. When

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
seat for a moment, apparently in intense enjoyment;
then jumped off his seat, turning round once or twice;
then he would listen
intently again, as if
afraid to lose a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see dis, I see dat,&rdquo;
said the preacher continually.
His listeners
seemed to see it too.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>At ten minutes to
twelve yesterday morning,
I called at the
White House. The
President had left the
library, but he was kind
enough to return, and
at twelve I had the
honor to spend a few minutes in the company of
General Benjamin Harrison. Two years ago I was
received by Mr. Grover Cleveland with the same
courtesy and the same total absence of red tape.</p>

<p>The President of the United States is a man about
fifty-five years old; short, exceedingly neat, and even
<i>recherché</i> in his appearance. The hair and beard are
white, the eyes small and very keen. The face is
severe, but lights up with a most gentle and kind
smile.</p>

<p>General Harrison is a popular president; but the
souvenir of Mrs. Cleveland is still haunting the minds
of the Washingtonians. They will never forget the
most beautiful lady who ever did the honors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
White House, and most of them look forward to the
possibility of her returning to Washington in March,
1893.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Washington society moves in circles and sets. The
wife of the President and the wives and daughters of
the Cabinet Ministers form the first set&mdash;Olympus, as
it were. The second set is composed of the ladies
belonging to the families of the Judges of the Supreme
Court! The Senators come next. The Army circle
comes fourth. The House of Representatives supplies
the last set. Each circle, a Washington friend tells me,
is controlled by rigid laws of etiquette. Senators&rsquo; wives
consider themselves much superior to the wives of
Congressmen, and the Judges&rsquo; wives consider themselves
much above those of the Senators. But, as a
rule, the great lion of Washington society is the British
Minister, especially when he happens to be a real live
English lord. All look up to him; and if a young
titled English <i>attaché</i> wishes to marry the richest
heiress of the capital, all he has to do is to throw the
handkerchief, the young and the richest natives do not
stand the ghost of a chance.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Lectured last night, in the Congregational Church,
to a large and most fashionable audience. Senator
Hoar took the chair, and introduced me in a short,
neat, gracefully worded little speech. In to-day&rsquo;s
Washington <i>Star</i>, I find the following remark:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The lecturer was handsomely introduced by Senator Hoar, who
combines the dignity of an Englishman, the sturdiness of a Scotchman,
the <i>savoir faire</i> of a Frenchman, and the culture of a Bostonian.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span></p>

<p>What a strange mixture! I am trying to find where
the compliment comes in, surely not in &ldquo;the <i>savoir
faire</i> of a Frenchman!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Armed with a kind letter of introduction to Miss Kate
Field, I called this morning at the office of this lady,
who is characterized by a prominent journalist as &ldquo;the
very brainiest woman in the United States.&rdquo; Unfortunately
she was out of town.</p>

<p>I should have liked to make the personal acquaintance
of this brilliant, witty woman, who speaks, I am
told, as she writes, in clear, caustic, fearless style.
My intention was to interview her a bit. A telegram
was sent to her in New York from her secretary, and
her answer was wired immediately: &ldquo;Interview <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
So, instead of interviewing Miss Kate Field, I was interviewed,
for her paper, by a young and very pretty
lady journalist.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Baltimore</i>, <i>April</i> 4.</p>

<p>I have spent the day here with some friends.</p>

<p>Baltimore strikes one as a quiet, solid, somewhat
provincial town. It is an eminently middle-class looking
city. There is no great wealth in it, no great activity;
but, on the other hand, there is little poverty;
it is a well-to-do city <i>par excellence</i>. The famous Johns
Hopkins University is here, and I am not surprised to
learn that Baltimore is a city of culture and refinement.</p>

<p>A beautiful forest, a mixture of cultivated park and
wilderness, about a mile from the town, must be a
source of delight to the inhabitants in summer and during
the beautiful months of September and October.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span> </p>

<p>I was told several times that Baltimore was famous
all over the States for its pretty women.</p>

<p>They were not out to-day. And as I have not been
invited to lecture in
Baltimore, I must be
content with hoping
to be more lucky
next time.</p>

tour is in America, just imagine that you lecture to-night
in London, to-morrow in Paris, then in Berlin,
then in Vienna, then in Constantinople, then in Teheran,
then in Bombay, and so forth. With this difference,
that if you had to undertake the work in Europe, at the

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">This</span> morning I went to Dr. Newton&rsquo;s church in
Forty-eighth Street. He has the reputation of
being one of the best preachers in New York, and the
choir enjoys an equally
great reputation. The
church was literally
packed until the sermon
began, and then
some of the strollers
who had come to hear
the anthems moved on.
Dr. Newton&rsquo;s voice and
delivery were not at all
to my taste, so I did
not sit out his sermon
either. He has a big,
unctuous voice, with
the intonations and inflections
of a showman
at the fair. He has
not the flow of ideas
that struck me so forcibly when I heard the late
Henry Ward Beecher in London; he has not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
histrionic powers of Dr. Talmage, either. There was
more show than beauty about the music, too. A bellowing,
shrieking soprano overpowered all the other
voices in the choir, including that of a really beautiful
tenor that deserved to be heard.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>New York blossoms like the rose on Easter Day.
Every woman has a new bonnet and walks abroad to
show it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:358px; height:240px" src="images/img356.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SOME EASTER BONNETS.</p></div>

<p>There are grades in millinery as there are in society.
The imported bonnet takes the proudest rank; it
is the aristocrat in the world of headgear. It does
not always come with the conqueror (in one of her
numerous trunks), but it always comes to conquer, and
a proud, though ephemeral triumph it enjoys, perched
on the dainty head of a New York belle, and supplemented
by a frock from Felix&rsquo;s or Redfern&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It is a unique sight, Fifth Avenue on Easter Sunday,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
when all the up-town churches have emptied themselves
of their gayly garbed worshipers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:316px; height:360px" src="images/img357.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">KEEPING LENT.</p></div>

<p>The &ldquo;four hundred&rdquo; have been keeping Lent in
polite, if not rigorous, fashion. Who shall say what it
has cost them in self-sacrifice to limit themselves to the
sober, modest violet for table and bonnet decoration
during six whole weeks? These things cannot be
lightly judged by the profane. I have even heard of
sweet, devout New York girls who limited themselves
to one pound of <i>marrons glacés</i> a week during Lent.
Such feminine heroism deserves mention.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:462px; height:430px" src="images/img358.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A CLUB WINDOW.</p></div>

<p>And have they not been sewing flannel for the poor,
once a week, instead of directing the manipulation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
silk and gauze for their own fair forms, all the week
long? Who shall gauge the self-control necessary for
fasting such as this? But now Dorcas meetings are
over, and dances begin again to-morrow. The Easter
anthem has been sung, and the imported bonnet takes
a turn on Fifth Avenue to salute and to hob-nob with
Broadway imitations during the hour between church
and lunch. To New Yorkers this Easter Church
parade is as much of an institution in its way as those
of Hyde Park during the season are to the Londoners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
It was plain that the people sauntering leisurely on the
broad sidewalks, the feminine portion at least, had not
come out solely for religious exercise in church, but
had every intention to see and to be seen, especially
the latter. On my way down, I saw some folks who
had not been to church, and only wanted to see, so
stood with faces glued to the windows of the big clubs,
looking out at the kaleidoscopic procession: old
bachelors, I daresay, who hold the opinion that spring
bonnets, whether imported or home-grown, ought to be
labeled &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo; At all events they were gazing
as one might gaze at some coveted but out-of-reach
fruit, and looking as if they dared not face their fascinating
young townswomen in all the splendor of their
new war paint. A few, perhaps, were married men,
and this was their quiet protest against fifty-dollar
hats and five-hundred-dollar gowns.</p>

<p>The sight was beautiful and one not to be forgotten.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>In the evening I dined with Colonel Robert G.
Ingersoll and the members of his family. I noticed
something which struck me as novel, but as perfectly
charming. Each man was placed at table by the side
of his wife, including the host and hostess. This
custom in the colonel&rsquo;s family circle (I was the only
guest not belonging to it) is another proof that his
theories are put into practice in his house. Dinner
and time vanished with rapidity in that house, where
everything breathes love and happiness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI.</h3>

<p class="tt">I Mount the Pulpit, and Preach on the Sabbath,
in the State of Wisconsin&mdash;The Audience is
Large and Appreciative; but I probably Fail
to Please One of the Congregation.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Milwaukee</i>, <i>April</i> 21.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">To</span> a certain extent I am a believer in climatic influence,
and am inclined to think that Sabbath
reformers reckon without the British climate when
they hope to ever see a Britain full of cheerful Christians.
M. Taine, in his &ldquo;History of English Literature,&rdquo;
ascribes the unlovable morality of Puritanism to
the influence of the British climate. &ldquo;Pleasure being
out of question,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;under such a sky, the Briton
gave himself up to this forbidding virtuousness.&rdquo; In
other words, being unable to be cheerful, he became
moral. This is not altogether true. Many Britons are
cheerful who don&rsquo;t look it, many Britons are not moral
who look it.</p>

<p>But how would M. Taine explain the existence of
this same puritanic &ldquo;morality&rdquo; which can be found
under the lovely, clear, bright sky of America? All
over New England, and indeed in most parts of America,
the same Kill-joy, the same gloomy, frowning
Sabbath-keeper is flourishing, doing his utmost to blot
the sunshine out of every recurring seventh day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span> </p>

<p>Yet Sabbath-keeping is a Jewish institution that
has nothing to do with Protestantism; but there have
always been Protestants more Protestant than Martin
Luther, and Christians more Christian than Christ.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 290px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:242px; height:340px" src="images/img361.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">PURITAN LACK OF CHEERFULNESS.</td></tr></table>

<p>Luther taught that the Sabbath was to be kept, not
because Moses commanded it, but because Nature
teaches us the necessity
of the seventh day&rsquo;s rest.
He says &ldquo;If anywhere
the day is made holy for
the mere day&rsquo;s sake,
then I command you to
work on it, ride on it,
dance on it, do anything
that will reprove this encroachment
on Christian
spirit and liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Scotch
woman, who &ldquo;did nae
think the betterer on&rdquo;
the Lord for that Sabbath-day
walk through
the cornfield, is not a
solitary type of Anglo-Saxon
Christian. But it is when these Puritans judge
other nations that they are truly great.</p>

<p>Puritan lack of charity and dread of cheerfulness
often lead Anglo-Saxon visitors to France to misjudge
the French mode of spending Sunday. Americans, as
well as English, err in this matter, as I had occasion
to find out during my second visit to America.</p>

<p>I had been lecturing last Saturday evening in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
pretty little town of Whitewater, in Wisconsin, and
received an invitation from a minister to address a
meeting that was to be held yesterday, Sunday, in the
largest church of the place to discuss the question,
&ldquo;How Sunday should be spent.&rdquo; I at first declined,
on the ground that it might not be exactly in good
taste for a foreigner to advise his hosts how to spend
Sunday. However, when it was suggested that I
might simply go and tell them how Sunday was spent
in France, I accepted the task.</p>

<p>The proceedings opened with prayer and an anthem;
and a hymn in praise of the Jewish Sabbath having
been chosen by the moderator, I thought the case
looked bad for us French people, and that I was going
to cut a poor figure.</p>

<p>The first speaker unwittingly came to my rescue by
making an onslaught upon the French mode of spending
the seventh day. &ldquo;With all due respect to the
native country of our visitor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am bound to
say that on the one Sunday which I spent in Paris, I
saw a great deal of low immorality, and I could not
help coming to the conclusion that this was due to the
fact of the French not being a Sabbath-keeping people.&rdquo;
He wound up with a strong appeal to his
townsmen to beware of any temptation to relax in
their observance of the fourth commandment as given
by Moses.</p>

<p>I was called upon to speak next. I rose in my pew,
but was requested to go into the rostrum.</p>

<p>With alacrity I stepped forward, a little staggered,
perhaps, at finding myself for the first time in a pulpit,
but quite ready for the fray.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span> </p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to hear the remarks made by
the speaker who has just sat down. I cannot, however,
help thinking that if our friend had spent that
Sunday in Paris in respectable places, he would have
been spared the sight of any low immorality. No
doubt Paris, like every large city in the world, has its
black spots, and you can easily discover them, if you
make proper inquiries as to where they are, and if you
are properly directed. Now, let me ask, where did he
go? I should very much like to know. Being an old
Parisian, I have still in my mind&rsquo;s eye the numerous
museums that are open free to the people on Sundays.
One of the most edifying sights in the city is that of
our peasants and workmen in their clean Sunday
blouses enjoying themselves with their families, and
elevating their tastes among our art treasures. Did
our friend go there? I know there are places where
for little money the symphonies of Beethoven and
other great masters may be and are enjoyed by thousands
every Sunday. Did our friend go there?
Within easy reach of the people are such places as
the Bois de Boulogne, the Garden of Acclimation,
where for fifty centimes a delightful day may be spent
among the lawns and flower-beds of that Parisian
&ldquo;Zoo.&rdquo; Its goat cars, ostrich cars, its camel and elephant
drives make it a paradise for children, and one
might see whole families there on Sunday afternoons
in the summer, the parents refreshing their bodies
with this contact with nature and their hearts with the
sight of the children&rsquo;s glee. Did our friend go there?
We even have churches in Paris, churches that are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
crammed from six o&rsquo;clock in the morning till one in
the afternoon with worshipers who go on their knees
to God. Now, did our friend go to church on that
Sunday? Well, where did he go? I am quitting
Whitewater to-morrow, and I leave it to his townspeople
to investigate the matter. When I first visited
New York, stories were told me of strange things to
be seen there even on a Sunday. Who doubts, I
repeat, that every great city has its black spots? I
had no desire to see those of New York, there was so
much that was better worth my time and attention.
If our friend, our observing friend, would only have
done in Paris as I did in New York, he would have
seen very little low immorality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little encounter at Whitewater was only one
more illustration of the strange fact that the Anglo-Saxon,
who is so good in his own country, so constant
in his attendance at church, is seldom to be seen in a
sacred edifice abroad, unless, indeed, he has been led
there by Baedeker.</p>

<p>And last night, at Whitewater, I went to bed pleased
with myself, like a man who has fought for his country.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>When I am in France, I often bore my friends with
advice, and find, as usual, that advice is a luxurious
gift thoroughly enjoyed by the one who gives it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to do these things,&rdquo; I say to
them; &ldquo;in England or in America, they are much
more intelligent; they do like this and like that.&rdquo;
And my friends generally advise me to return to England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
or America, where things are so beautifully managed.</p>

<p>But, when I am out of France, the old Frenchman is
all there, and if you pitch into my mother country, I
stand up ready to fight at a minute&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.</h3>

<p class="tt">The Origin of American Humor and Its Characteristics&mdash;The
Sacred and the Profane&mdash;The
Germans and American Humor&mdash;My
Corpse Would &ldquo;Draw,&rdquo; in My Impresario&rsquo;s
Opinion.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Madison, Wis.</i>, <i>April</i> 22.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">Have</span> been lecturing during the past fortnight in
about twelve places, few of which possessed any
interest whatever. One of them, however&mdash;Cincinnati&mdash;I
was glad to see again.</p>

<p>This town of Madison is the only one that has really
struck me as being beautiful. From the hills the scenery
is perfectly lovely, with its wooded slopes and lakes.
Through the kindness of Governor Hoard, I have had
a comprehensive survey of the neighborhood; for he
has driven me in his carriage to all the prettiest spots,
delighting me all the while with his conversation. He
is one of those Americans whom you may often meet if
you have a little luck: witty, humorous, hospitable,
kind-hearted, the very personification of unaffected
good-fellowship.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on humor.</p>

<p>I have always wondered what the origin of American
humor can be; where is or was the fountain-head. You
certainly find humor in England among the cultured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
classes, but the class of English people who emigrate
cannot have imported much humor into America.
Surely Germany and Scandinavia cannot have contributed
to the fund, either. The Scotch have dry, quiet,
pawky, unconscious humor; but their influence can
hardly have been great enough to implant their quaint
native &ldquo;wut&rdquo; in American soil. Again, the Irish bull
is droll, but scarcely humorous. The Italians, the Hungarians,
have never yet, that I am aware of, been suspected
of even latent humor.</p>

<p>What then, can be the origin of American humor, as
we know it, with its naïve philosophy, its mixture of
the sacred and the profane, its exaggeration and that
preposterousness which so completely staggers the
foreigner, the French and the German especially?</p>

<p>The mixing of sacred with profane matter, no doubt,
originated with the Puritans themselves, and is only
an outcome of the cheek-by-jowl, next-door-neighbor
fashion of addressing the Higher Powers, which is so
common in the Scotch. Many of us have heard of the
Scotch minister, whom his zeal for the welfare of missionaries
moved to address Heaven in the following
manner: &ldquo;We commend to thy care those missionaries
whose lives are in danger in the Fiji Islands ...
which, Thou knowest, are situated in the Pacific Ocean.&rdquo;
And he is not far removed in our minds from the New
England pastor, who preached on the well-known text
of St. Paul, and having read: &ldquo;All things are possible
to me,&rdquo; took a five-dollar bill out of his pocket, and
placing it on the edge of the pulpit, said: &ldquo;No, Paul,
that is going too far. I bet you five dollars that you
can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But continuing the reading of the text:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
&ldquo;Through Christ who strengtheneth me,&rdquo; exclaimed,
&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a very different matter!&rdquo; and put back the
five-dollar bill in his pocket.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:444px; height:430px" src="images/img368.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE MISSIONARY AND THE FIJIS.</p></div>

<p>This kind of amalgamation of the sacred and profane
is constantly confronting one in American soil,
and has a firm foothold in American humor.</p>

<p>Colonel Elliott F. Shepard, proprietor of the New
York <i>Mail and Express</i>, every morning sends to the
editor a fresh text from the Bible for publication at the
top of the editorials. One day that text was received,
but somehow got lost, and by noon was still unfound.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
I was told that &ldquo;you should have heard the compositors&rsquo;
room ring with: &lsquo;Where can that d&mdash;&mdash;d text
be?&rsquo;&rdquo; Finally the text was wired and duly inserted.
These men, however, did not intend any religious disrespect.
Such a thing was probably as far from their
minds as it was from the minds of the Puritan preachers
of old. There are men who swear, as others pray,
without meaning anything. One is a bad habit, the
other a good one.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>All that naïve philosophy, with which America
abounds, must, I fancy, be the outcome of hardship endured
by the pioneers of former days, and by the
Westerner of our own times.</p>

<p>The element of exaggeration, which is so characteristic
of American humor, may be explained by the
rapid success of the Americans and the immensity of
the continent which they inhabit. Everything is on a
grand scale, or suggests hugeness. Then negro humor
is mainly exaggeration, and has no doubt added its
quota to the compound which, as I said just now,
completely staggers certain foreigners.</p>

<p>Governor Hoard was telling me to-day that a German
was inclined to be offended with him for saying
that the Germans, as a rule, were unable to see through
an American joke, and he invited Governor Hoard to
try the effect of one upon him. The governor, thereupon
told him the story of the tree, &ldquo;out West,&rdquo; which
was so high that it took two men to see to the top.
One of them saw as far as he could, then the second
started from the place where the first stopped seeing,
and went on. The recital did not raise the
ghost of a smile, and Governor Hoard then said to

<p>And he is still convinced that he can see through an
American joke.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Grand Rapids</i>, <i>April</i> 24.</p>

<p>Have had to-day a lovely, sublime example of that
preposterousness which so often characterizes American
humor.</p>

<p>Arrived here this morning from Chicago. At noon,
the Grand Rapidite who was &ldquo;bossing the show&rdquo;
called upon me at the Morton House, and kindly inquired
whether there was anything he could do for
me. Before leaving, he said: &ldquo;While I am here, I
may as well give you the check for to-night&rsquo;s lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you call
that risky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I may die before the evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll exhibit
your corpse; I guess there will be just as much money
in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p>Grand Rapids is noted for its furniture manufactories.
A draughtsman, who is employed to design artistic
things for the largest of these manufactories,
kindly showed me over the premises of his employers.
I was not very surprised to hear that when the various
retail houses come to make their yearly selections,
they will not look at any models of the previous
season, so great is the rage for novelties in every
branch of industry in this novelty-loving America.

<p>No sinecure, that draughtsman&rsquo;s position, I can tell
you.</p>

<p>Over in Europe, furniture is reckoned by periods.
Here it is an affair of seasons.</p>

<p>Very funny to have to order a new sideboard or
wardrobe, &ldquo;to be sent home without delay&rdquo; for fear of
its being out of date.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.</h3>

<p class="tt">Good-by to America&mdash;Not &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Au
Revoir&rdquo;&mdash;On Board the &ldquo;Teutonic&rdquo;&mdash;Home
Again.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>New York</i>, <i>April</i> 26.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc1">The</span> last two days have vanished rapidly in paying
calls.</p>

<p>This morning my impresario gave me a farewell
breakfast at the Everett House. Edmund Clarence
Stedman was there; Mark Twain, George Kennan,
General Horace Porter, General Lloyd Bryce, Richard
Watson Gilder, and many others sat at table, and
joined in wishing me <i>bon voyage</i>.</p>

<p>Good-by, my dear American friends, I shall carry
away sweet recollections of you, and whether I am re-invited
in your country or not, I will come again.</p>

<p class="tb">.......</p>

<p class="rt"><i>April</i> 27.</p>

<p>The saloon on board the <i>Teutonic</i> is a mass of
floral offerings sent by friends to the passengers.
Two huge beautiful baskets of lilies and roses are
mine.</p>

<p>The whistle is heard for the third time. The hands
are pressed and the faces kissed, and all those who are
not passengers leave the boat and go and take up position
on the wharf to wave their handkerchiefs until the
steamer is out of sight. A great many among the
dense crowd are friendly faces familiar to me.

<p>The huge construction is set in motion, and gently
and smoothly glides from the docks to the Hudson
River. The sun is shining, the weather glorious.</p>

<p>The faces on land get less and less distinct. For
the last time I wave my hat.</p>

<p>Hallo, what is the matter with me? Upon my
word, I believe I am sad. I go to the library, and,
like a child, seize a dozen sheets of note paper on
which I write: &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo; I will send them to New
York from Sandy Hook.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:470px; height:291px" src="images/img376.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE &ldquo;TEUTONIC.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The <i>Teutonic</i> is behaving beautifully. We pass
Sandy Hook. The sea is perfectly calm. Then I
think of my dear ones at home, and the happiest
thoughts take the place of my feelings of regret at
leaving my friends.</p>

<p>My impresario, Major J. B. Pond, shares a beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
well-lighted, airy cabin with me. He is coming to
England to engage Mr. Henry M. Stanley for a lecture
tour in America next season.</p>

<p>The company on board is large and choice. In the
steerage a few disappointed American statesmen return
to Europe.</p>

<p>Oh! that <i>Teutonic!</i> can any one imagine anything
more grand, more luxurious? She is going at the rate
of 450 miles a day. In about five days we shall be at
Queenstown.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Liverpool</i>, <i>May</i> 4.</p>

<p>My most humble apologies are due to the Atlantic
for libeling that ocean at the beginning of this book.
For the last six days the sea has been perfectly calm,
and the trip has been one of pleasure the whole time.
Here is another crowd on the landing-stage at Liverpool.</p>

<p>And now, dear reader, excuse me if I leave you.
You were present at the friendly farewell handshakings
on the New York side; but, on this Liverpool quay, I
see a face that I have not looked upon for five months,
and having a great deal to say to the owner of it, I
will politely bow you out first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any one was absurd enough to feel aggrieved at Max O&rsquo;Rell&rsquo;s amusement

not a dull line in it from first to last, and its information is as genuine and
accurate in the way of glimpses into the more intimate life of the people
as it is charming in its sparkle and glow of style.&mdash;<i>Boston Evening Traveller.</i></p>

side of things, and that with unvarying good humor, apparently indifferent
whether the joke hits himself or somebody else.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Troy Budget.</i></p>
